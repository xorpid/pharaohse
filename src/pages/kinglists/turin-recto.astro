	<p>
		Historically, the tax-register has had little to no significance other than to aid in the verification of fragment position. Egyptologists have
		made little effort to reconstruct the text because it is much sparserly written than the king list on the verso. Because of the fragmentary
		nature, accurate translation and interpretation are extremely difficult. There seems to be only two translation attempts: Helck’s from 1992 and
		Warburton’s from 1997.

		The original papyrus once recorded a series of tax records, ostensibly for the administration. Unfortunately, the fragmentary records does not
		preserve an administrative region or location, but refer to the handling of many different wares, such as wine, cattle, charcoal, gold etc. Many
		types of profession are listed in a number of locations, especially oases in the Fayuum.

		<blockquote>
			<p class="px-3">
				The papyrus is very fragmentary, and thus a translation does not necessarily throw much light on the subject, but some parts are well enough
				preserved to justify presentation here, and some of the references may be fragmentary and of no value in the context of this papyrus, but can
				be used to elucidate other references.<br />
				It is of course amusing to try and fit some of the missing fragments into positions, but this has been tried many times, and does not necessarily
				demonstrate the hypothesis. As the interpretation of fragmentory texts is highly speculative in any case, the temptation to philological discussion
				has thus been suppressed. A serious attempt at commentary of this particular text would unfortunately lead one immediately into the realm of insubstantial
				fantasy.

			<h3 class="text-center">REMARKS</h3>
			<p>
				This execrably preserved papyrus once recorded a series of records concerning various fiscal activities, naming the term employed along with
				the person upon whom the obligation was put, and the precise objects which were turned over to the administration as a result of this. It must
				be emphasized that it does not appear from the fragmentary remains visible today that the lists recorded to whom the payments were made (with
				the exception of "which is upon him for Pharaoh", 3, 14). Geographically, it certainly referred to oases and the Fayum, administratively, it
				seems to have covered many different types of profession, and the diversity of the objects rendered up includes wine, charcoal, fish, cattle,
				gold, etc. The value of the papyrus being considerably impaired as a result of its fragmentary state, the following conclusions resemble the
				above "translation" in being restrained rather than exuberant, and attempt to summarize the conclusions which can be justifiably drawn from
				the text, without undue exaggeration.
			</p>
			<p>
				It would seem that the words wrilten in red ink had some particular significance, and these include <tlit
					>tp-&#7695;rt, &scaron;&#42786;yw, b&#42786;kw,</tlit
				> but also <tlit>&scaron;dyt</tlit>. This necessarily implies that these terms were in some way significant, and it is evident that the term
				b&#42786;kw and the term &scaron;&#42786;yt are employed in a very similar fashion, not only being written in red, but serving as the basis
				for a series of assessments (<tlit>b&#42786;kw</tlit> in fish and silver;
				<tlit>&scaron;&#42786;yw</tlit> in cattle), underlining that the scribe concerned here was using <tlit>b&#42786;kw</tlit> in a fiscal sense.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aside from the word for annual, certain of the rotes of assessment, and the word for summary, only one title is written is red (if "hunter" is
				the correct rendering), and this only once (and it is assumed here that this is an oversight), so it is assumed that no particular importance
				was associated with the officials, but that these terms of reference (rotes of assessment, etc.) were significant.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is pointless to attempt to use the text statistically, so that the categories alone are worthy of attention. Where preserved, <tlit
					>b&#42786;kw</tlit
				> is never associated with officials, as opposed to workers, while the opposite is true of <tlit>tp-&#7695;rt. &scaron;&#42786;yw</tlit> seems
				to be employed with regard to both classes of people (cf. 3, 19) and institutions (cf. 3, 4), as well as officials and individuals (cf. 4/5, 20ff.;
				col. 7).
			</p>
			<p>
				Conversely, professional administrators (mayors, overseers, deputies, scribes, controllers) outnumber workers (fishermen, fowlers, guardians,
				mat weavers), but they all figure alongside one another, but wherever possible, it would appear that the types of obligations that they owe
				are clearly distinguished, although the jottings physically mix the categories, they are clearly differentiated).
			</p>
			<p class="pb-5">
				In the preserved text, fish and cattle are the most important items listed, but gold and silver figure to a striking extent. It is striking
				that successive lines list alternatively mats, whips, fowl, fish and silver (or gold), and that - seemingly - only cattle were deliberately
				grouped together and kept apart. Although an entire deben of gold is explicitly collected from the natron guardian (3,2), 471 it would appear
				that there is otherwise no evidence of the employment of financial substitutions or equivalencies for exactions intended to be delivered in
				fish, mats, wine, reeds, gum, or geese, etc., and thus it seems fair to conclude that the actual articles listed were assessed, assembled, and
				acquired.
