		The fragmented nature of the Turin king list papyrus makes a precise interpretation difficult. It necessitates a careful analysis of the papyrus's
		physical state as well as all of its contents, especially the king list, but both sides are looked at.
	</p>

	<div>
		<h2>Origin and purpose</h2>
		<p>
			As with most papyri, the provenance of this papyrus roll is uncertain, but indirect evidence point to the Theban necropolis as the likely place
			of discovery. It is a distinct possibility that it was found in the tomb of a scribe, as the papyrus was reused. However, it is basically just
			guesswork.
		</p>
		<p>
			The original document contained a tax-register written sometime during the reign of Ramesses II (1279–1213 BCE), or one of his close successors.<button
				popovertarget="pop1">1</button
			> When this tax-record became obsolete, the blank back side was used to add the king list, most likely while the papyrus was still relatively new,
			though a few years to a decade later cannot be ruled out. It contains the records of every Egyptian king with his exact position in chronological
			order, from the gods to the mortal kings.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Turin King List is often referred to as a canon, but that designation implies a selection based on doctrine, which would have suppressed or
			omitted kings considered illegitimate. The inscribed king lists of Abydos, Saqqara, and Karnak deliberately excluded several rulers and should
			be classified as canons.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Turin King List, on the other hand, is a chronological list of kings, with no indications of excluded or suppressed kings. The length of
			their reigns is included, which is absent from all the other lists, and the chronological order seems to be reliable in most cases. <i
				>The Royal Canon of Turin</i
			> is undoubtedly a more memorable moniker than
			<i>the Turin King List</i>, however, accuracy is of importance, which is why this website prefer to use <b>the Turin King List</b>.
		</p>

		<p>
			We can safely assume the reign of Ramesses II as the original date of creation, but this does not necessarily mean the list included any of the
			kings of the New Kingdom. Early in the Eighteenth Dynasty, the administration likely needed a chronological record of the kingdom for political
			and/or religious reasons. By associating himself with well-known ancestors, the king asserted and legitimized his right to rule the Two Lands.

		<h2>Dating the papyrus</h2>
		<figure class="float-right pl-3">
			<img src="/images/T-Ramesses2recto.png" alt="Ramesses II on the recto" />
			<figcaption class="text-sm text-center py-2">Ramesses II, recto (fr. 10+11)</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			There is no preserved date written on the papyrus roll, neither on the tax-register (<i>recto</i>), nor on the king-list (<i>verso</i>). The
			recto mentions an <i>“Inspector of the wells of Ramesses Meryamun,”</i> an official during the reign of Ramesses II, indicating that the tax-register
			was created either during his reign, or possibly shortly afterward, as the office could have persisted for a few years during the remaining Nineteenth
			Dynasty. It cannot be determined whether the content of the king list was updated to include any of the New Kingdom kings, or simply was a copy of
			an even older list. The king-list comes to an end in the section that records the kings of the Late Second Intermediate Period (SIP), the last fully
			preserved name is Sekhemra Shedwaset, <i>“the Might of Ra which rescues Thebes,”</i> an otherwise unattested Theban king, ruling late in the SIP.
		</p>
		<p>
			Orthographically, the hieratic text also suggests a Nineteenth Dynasty origin, but until carbon dating of the papyrus is performed, we can only
			estimate a date of creation to sometime during the reign of Ramesses II (c. 1279&mdash;1213 BC), making the papyrus more than 3200 years old.
		</p>

		<p>
			Following the death of Queen Neferusobek (died 1802 BC), the last ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty, the chronology for the next several centuries is
			sparse, chaotic and confusing, which is why the period is dubbed the SIP. The lack of contemporary records make any specific theory as to the
			cause highly speculative, but the number of competing dynasties support a weakening of the central government. The records from Manetho show
			that his records too were a corrupted mess.

			This is a clear indication that not even the Egyptians themselves had a clear picture of the events that took place during these troubled times.
			The records that survived were not always complete, nor fully preserved, making it all but impossible to get a clear picture, which is
			understandable as the timespan is not mere decades but centuries. Furthermore, Manetho is also susceptible to translation and transcription
			errors by the non-native epitomists, that could not be expected to correctly interpret the strange and foreign names. The Turin king list
			preserve a total of 138 kings<button popovertarget="pop2">2</button> after the Twelfth Dynasty, but we are left in the dark as to where it ended.

		<h2 class="py-5">Physical characteristics</h2>
		<p>
			To determine the physical properties of the papyrus roll, careful consideration of the joins and patches is necessary to assure the position of
			the columns according to established research. A full-size papyrus roll during the New Kingdom usually consisted of up to twenty sheets,<button
				popovertarget="pop3">3</button
			> aligned with the right edge of one sheet overlapping the left of the next, joined together by adding an adhesive starch paste, and flattening the
			joins with a mallet.<button popovertarget="pop4">4</button><br />
			The papyrus is roughly 43 cm in height, corresponding to a full-sized roll,<button popovertarget="pop5">5</button> and measure about 169 cm in length,
			or about six and a half joined sheets (see Table 2), for an total area of 7267 cm<sup>2</sup>. The placed fragments amount to an area of 2116 cm<sup
				>2</sup
			>, or only about 29% of the original papyrus, not including the fragments Gardiner marked <i>&quot;doubtful and useless&quot;</i>.<button
				popovertarget="pop6">6</button
			>
		</p>

		<p>
			Obviously, single sheets of papyri would be troublesome to use and handle in many ways, especially storage. So to create a larger writing
			surface, a number of sheets were pasted together, or “joined.” The joins can be easily seen, and from the size and position of the fragments, it
			is obvious that two are missing; one to the right of column 3, and one to the right of column 11. With six joins, we can determine that the
			complete roll consisted of seven sheets, each about 265 mm wide, for a total width of about 1855 mm. The alignment of the fragments is not
			perfect in all cases, as small variations naturally occurr, such as stretching one part only on the vertical axis, but another only on the
			horizontal, while yet another will be stretched on both, or none.

			When produced, the papyrus roll was rolled up with sheet 7 as the innermost sheet, only exposing the rightmost part of sheet 1. It was probably
			fastened A narrow strip of papyrus was most likely added along the right edge of Sheet 1 to strengthen it, protecting the exposed outer part of
			the roll from tearing when unrolled, but this also made it thicker.<button popovertarget="pop7">7</button>
		</p>
		<p>
			When the tax-register had served its purpose, instead of discarding it, the blank verso was reused for the kinglist. This process of reusing
			papyri was probably done regularly and entailed little more than trimming and rerolling the papyrus. It would also be natural to remove the
			thicker part since it would likely had suffered from wear by constant handling, and as it would become the innermost sheet for the king list, it
			would naturally resist being rolled up. It definitely would seem prudent to remove this section to create a structurally sound refurbished
			papyrus roll. It is also entirely possible that this section was cut off to be reused once the kinglist had served its purpose.<button

			The ancient Egyptians did not roll papyri around bone or wooden sticks like the Romans did.<button popovertarget="pop9">9</button> With the papyrus
			roll ready for use, it was turned over horizontally, and rolled back with the tax-register on the outside and the blank side ready for use on the
			inside. Rerolling was not good for the integrity of the papyrus as it had already settled with the horizontal fibres on the inside, but it probably
			mattered little to the scribe as it was not intended to be kept in the archives. The trimming of the sheet meant that it lost approximately 130-150
			mm; shortening the papyrus roll to approximately 1705 mm.

		<h2>The hieratic</h2>
		<p>
			The paleography indicates that the signs are similar to those found in other documents from the late Nineteenth or early Twentieth Dynasties,
			and it is evident that the papyrus was not produced by a single hand, but rather by a number of copyists. An indispensable source for
			transcribing hieratic is the <i>Hieratiche Paläographie</i>,<button popovertarget="pop12">12</button> especially volume 2 which concentrates on the
			hieratic of the New Kingdom. The transcription of the hieratic script is obviously best left to experienced palaeologists who can distinguish and
			interpret the smallest traces and nuances in the script. Gardiner’s transcription is, as expected, correct, with emendations and clarifications by
			Ryholt.<button popovertarget="pop13">13</button> The orthography of the names is mostly correct, but a few names were damaged or erroneously copied.
			The transcription made by Gardiner is as expected, very good, only a few very minor corrections have been suggested by later studies.
		</p>
		<p>
			The hieratic text consists of 24–31 horizontal lines written in eleven columns, from right to left. The columns are 8–17 cm wide; with a line
			spacing of about 5 mm, but in columns 2 and 11, it is almost zero.<button popovertarget="pop14">14</button> The first 2&frac12; columns list gods,
			demigods, and spirits; the remaining 8&frac12;, the historical kings.
		</p>
		<p>
			Roman numerals have been used ever since the facsimiles by Lepsius, but to avoid confusion with the new reconstructions, plain numbers are used.
			To distinguish text in the papyrus, each column and row of the papyrus is numbered and put in parenthesis, except when used in a table. For
			example, (4.7) refers to column 4, row 7, which was written as IV 7 in older works.
		</p>
		<p>
			The historical kings begin with Meni (3.10) and occupy the rest of the papyrus. The number of lines increases as the papyrus nears the end, as
			the scribe needed to compact the writing to be able to fit all the remaining kings onto the papyrus. The list of kings ends in column 11 with
			partial names of unidentifiable late Second Intermediate Period kings.

			It can be safely assumed that the king list was preceded with some sort of introduction describing the nature of its content, probably including
			the date and name of the scribe, but unfortunately, the first column is almost entirely lost. The structural similarity (gods &rArr; spirits
			&rArr; mortal kings) with the king lists of Manetho was noted already by Champollion and attempts to reconcile the two has been attempted ever
			since.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="sek">
		<h2>Ditto marks and rubra</h2>
		<p>
			Writing the same text over and over is tedious and unnecessary, the scribes of Egypt had long since learned to use ditto marks for repeating
			words or sentences. A hieratic ditto mark simply consists of a dot,<button popovertarget="pop15">15</button> and was used in the king list to replace
			three texts: The name of each king is followed by the text <i>“he acted in kingship”</i> which was only written out at the top of a column, and ditto
			marks were used below that for the repeating text. Ditto marks were also used for the signs for <i>months,</i> and <i>days</i>, but never for <i
				>years</i
			>. Numbers were always written out in full.
		</p>
		<p>The full formula for an entry reads:</p>
		<p>
			<img loading="lazy" class="w-5/6 h-auto dark:invert" src="/svg/T-ditto1.svg" alt="He acted in kingship x years, y months, z days" /><br />
			Dual King <b>Name</b>. He acted in kingship <b>x</b> years, <b>y</b> months and
			<b>z</b> days.<button popovertarget="pop16">16</button><br />
			<span class="tlit">nsw-bit <b>Name</b> ir.n=f m nswyt rnpt <b>x</b> &#42786;bd <b>y</b> hrw <b>z</b></span>
		</p>

		<p>Using ditto marks, the same line looks like this:</p>
		<p class="pb-3">
			<img
				loading="lazy"
				class="w-5/6 h-auto dark:invert"
				src="/svg/T-ditto2.svg"
				alt="He acted in kingship x years, y months, z days using ditto marks"
			/>
		</p>
		<p>
			Most likely the source used for the king list was a half-size papyrus since the top rows of columns 4 and 9 contain ditto marks. This means that
			the scribe made a sign-by-sign copy of the original, not caring that the ditto marks were out of sync with the topmost row, nor that the
			kingship formula occurs at irregular intervals within the columns.
		</p>

		<p>The list of kings contains a total of 31 rows with ditto-marks.</p>
		<p>
			Red ink (Latin: <i>Rubra</i>) was used to highlight some words on rows concerning the historical kings, except 1.21 which belong to the section
			of gods. The only royal title that is written in red ink is for Djoser, doubtless due to his good reputation in later times. Red ink was also
			used on the unplaced Fr. 4.

		<h2>Headings and summations</h2>
		<p>
			There are six headings and ten summations in the king list, which divide it into five sections. The first four summations suggest that different
			sources were used to gather the data, rather than any historical division by the Egyptians themselves. To them the line of kings was
			uninterrupted. However, the dynastic divisions were likely invented during the Ptolemaic Dynasty a millennia later, as Manetho divided the
			periods covered in the papyrus into nineteen dynasties. Furthermore, the two Intermediate Periods are modern definitions of the breakdown of the
			Old and the Middle Kingdoms.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dynasties of Egypt as we know them were clearly not defined by the time of the New Kingdom, it seems to be a later invention during the
			Ptolemaic Period. The headings and summations divide the papyrus into sections similar to the dynasties of Manetho, however, there are only
			eleven clear divisions, or dynasties, not nineteen as would be expected. By the time of Manetho, the list of kings had evolved and been divided
			into better defined periods.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most numbers found in the king list, follow after the name of a specific king, detailing the length of his reign. Numbers are also found in
			summations, but not in headings. The numbers in summations specify the number of kings, the length that particular group of kings reigned, and
			totals calculated where multiple groupings are summed up. The reliability of the totals in the summations is impossible to assess, as no section
			of the papyrus preserves all the individual reign-lengths.
		</p>
		<p>
			The papyrus is arranged into two parts: mythological and historical kings. The mythological part can further be divided into three sections:
			gods, demigods, and spirits, as per Manetho. The historical part is a sequence of kings that are arranged chronologically, with headings and
			summations at irregular intervals. The headings provide the name of the founder, after which each king is listed, followed by a summation that
			calculates the number of kings and the duration of their reigns.
		</p>
		<p>
			The headings and summations divide the papyrus into sections similar to the dynasties of Manetho, however, there are only eleven clear divisions
			or dynasties, not nineteen as would be expected.
		</p>
		<p>
			The historical king list can be divided into six sections, each starting with a heading, naming the founder and from where the kings ruled.
			Following this is a sequential list of kings and their reign length, one per line, and lastly, a summation of the section, where the duration
			and the number of kings are calculated. There are only six headings, but ten summations, some of which obviously have no corresponding heading,
			effectively yielding ten distinct periods (see Table 5.)
		</p>
		<p>
			It is tempting to equate those ten periods with the dynasties of Manetho, and while there are general similarities, dynasties 1–10 appears as
			one heading and four summations in the papyrus. However, better-defined dynasties had likely appeared in the tradition by the time of Manetho, a
			millennium later.

		<h2>Details about the kings</h2>
		<p>
			Only a few fragments remain of the mythological section of the papyrus, presumably detailing gods, demigods, and spirits. The mythological kings
			mentioned by Manetho<button popovertarget="pop25">25</button> were likely present at the beginning of the papyrus, as the names of Gods are found
			in the first column, probably describing the Great Ennead. Most of this section is sadly almost entirely lost.
		</p>
		<p>
			The historical kings begin with Meni of the First Dynasty, and continue to the end of the Second Intermediate Period, where the papyrus is in
			tatters, and only a few small fragments survive. While there are no information about the gender in the king list, Manetho explicitly refers to
			several female rulers, meaning there must have existed some sort of traditional lists where the gender was included. Only one female ruler has
			been identified in the king list, Sobekneferu (7.2), but with no indication of gender.
		</p>

		<p>
			On each line, the title <tlit>nsw-bit</tlit> (<i>the Dual King</i>, or <i>The King of Upper and Lower Egypt</i>) precedes the king’s prenomen
			enclosed in a cartouche, followed by the divine determinative,<button popovertarget="pop26">26</button>
			indicating their divinity. It remains unknown why the recorded names in the New Kingdom king lists are not always the expected prenomen. The early
			dynasties use of the nebty name is understandable, as the kings of that period did not use prenomina, as is the scribe adding the nomen into the
			cartouche of kings with the same prenomen, presumably to distinguish them from each other. This inconsistency is also present in Manetho, where most
			recorded names use the Greek form of the prenomen, but a few use the nomen instead. There is evidence of hypercorrection of the royal names over
			time, that is, by adding the ubiquitous divine <i>-ra</i> to their name. The variations of the recorded names in the king list can be found in Table
			7.
		</p>
		<p>
			The recording of the names of the kings is inconsistent throughout the papyrus, likely due to gathering information from multiple sources (see
			0). There is no mention of concurrent dynasties, coregency, ethnicity, gender, reputation, or any other secondary criterion. The only exceptions
			are two kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty that include the names of their fathers.<button popovertarget="pop27">27</button>
		</p>

		<p>
			The G7-sign <img loading="lazy" class="inline h-8 dark:invert" src="/svg/G7.svg" alt="Gardiner’s G7-sign" />
			<i>“Horus/falcon on a standard”</i>, is a determinative/logogram for ’king’ or ’god,’ and often placed within the cartouche to emphasize a royal
			name, but also immediately adjacent behind the cartouche.

			This formula followed immediately after a kings name, followed by the length of reign, near the end of each row, like a spreadsheet. These
			numbers were arranged in columns, leaving empty space between the king’s name and the reign. Despite the lack of ditto-marks, this is a clear
			indication that the formula was implied, but not written.

		<h3 class="py-10">Number of kings</h3>
		<p>
			Determining the number of kings found on the papyrus, we first find the total number of lines in columns 3–11, which is 250 (see Table 8.)
			Discarding the ten rows of the spirits in 3.1–9, and the empty 3.14, 240 lines remain. The headings and summations of the dynasties account for
			another 18 lines, subtracting these, the total number of remaining lines, or kings, is 223. The names of 97 kings are lost or consist only of a
			single sign or traces, leaving 73 partial names, and only 53 complete names.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are 76 kings listed before the eight of the Twelfth Dynasty, followed by 139 of the Second Intermediate Period, totalling 223 kings, not
			accounting for names that were lost in lacuna notations.

			Accounting for the 61 rows that does not concern the dynastic kings, we have the rows of column 1 (25) and 2 (26), plus the first nine of column

		<h3 class="py-10">Years and age of the kings</h3>
		<p>
			The dates are recorded in one of two ways: either as a specific number of years, months and days, or simply as a number of years. The completely
			random distribution of the year ligatures throughout the king list suggest that either inattentive scribes mixed up the words, or the king list
			was compiled from different sources. In modern studies, the cursive hieratic has been interpreted as these variants: <img
				loading="lazy"
				class="inline dark:invert h-5"
				src="/svg/rnpt2.svg"
				alt="variants of rnpt in the Royal Canon of Turin"
			/><br />Hieratic is a cursive script that can be difficult to read and prone to errors unless the scribe pays close attention. Handwriting
			varies from person to person; some is harder to read and some is more elegant, for example. Small changes in language over the millennia also
			made the interpretation or meaning of ancient texts more difficult.
		</p>
		<p>
			To be consistent, the ligature is presumed to be <img
				loading="lazy"
				class="inline dark:invert h-5"
				src="/svg/rnpt1.svg"
				alt="rnpt Hsb (regnal years)"
			/> &nbsp;<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rnpt-%E1%B8%A5sb" target="_blank"><tlit>rnpt-&#7717;sb</tlit></a> (<i>regnal years</i>),
			despite the different ligatures.<button popovertarget="pop28">28</button> The older interpretations
			<tlit>&#7717;&#42786;t-sp</tlit> and <tlit>rnpt-sp</tlit> are no longer regarded as correct.
		</p>
		<!-- see Gundacker 2015:The Chronology of the Third and Fourth Dynasties p 133ff -->
		<p>
			It is immediately noticable that the reigns are recorded in different ways. The more ancient parts also contain more corrupted names. It all
			point to that at least five sources were used to create the original king list, and can be divided into five sections:
		</p>
		<ul class="pl-3 py-6">
			<li><b>Source A</b> &mdash; Dynasties 1–2, recording years, months, days and the age of the king.</li>
			<li><b>Source B</b> &mdash; Dynasties 3–6, recording only years.</li>
			<li><b>Source C</b> &mdash; Dynasties 7–10, recording years, months and days.</li>
			<li><b>Source D</b> &mdash; Dynasty 11, only recording years</li>
			<li><b>Source E</b> &mdash; Dynasty 12-, recording years, months and days.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The ages of the early kings (3.11–4.5) are recorded after their reign lengths, by the formula:</p>
		<img loading="lazy" class="inline dark:invert h-8 my-3" src="/svg/aha.svg" alt="Royal Canon of Turin: ‘in his lifetime’ formula" /><br />
		His lifetime<br />
		<tlit>&#42788;&#7717;&#42786;=f m &#42788;n&#7723;</tlit><br /><br />

		<p>
			This formula was likely derived from <b>Source A</b>, detailing kings of the first two dynasties only. There are no indications that the other
			sources held this information. However, the ages should be viewed with due scepticism, as they seem uncommonly high for the times.

		<h3 class="py-10">Reign lengths and totals</h3>
		<p>
			As can be expected, it is impossible to assess the credibility of the reigns attributed in the papyrus. The quality of the sources used to
			compile the reigns are unknown, and as a result, the reliability of the numbers is impossible to quantify. The uncertainty of the reign-lengths
			of even well-attested kings makes assessing the numbers an impossible task. A mathematical error produced at any time during the multiple
			sources, and their copies, could have remained undetected, and impossible to correct.
		</p>

		<p>
			Most figures found in the king list, follow after the name of a specific king, detailing the length of his reign. Numbers are also found in
			summations, but not in headings. The numbers in summations specify the number of kings, the length that particular group of kings reigned, and
			totals calculated where multiple groupings are summed up. The reliability of the totals in the summations is impossible to assess, as no section
			of the papyrus preserves all the individual reign-lengths. The total for the individual reign-lengths is calculated in Table 10 below.

			The inconsistent details provided about the individual kings are more apparent in the older parts of the document. This is hardly surprising

			undoubtedly have occurred, which would have permutated the original texts, causing some kings and information about their reigns to be lost.
			Each subsequent copy also compounded the errors, and ultimately resulted in a somewhat inaccurate duplicate of a duplicate etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			The age of Kakau (3.21) was left blank, perhaps by simple omission. The cartouche open is missing from the records of Sneferka (3.25), Nebka
			(4.4), and Snoferu (4.9). The summation of Dynasty XVI (11.15) preserve the number of kings as 5, while there are 15 entries (10.31 to 11.14),
			probably due to a scribal error.

		<h2>Notation of lacuna</h2>
		<p>
			Several notations of <img
				loading="lazy"
				class="h-6 inline dark:invert"
				src="/svg/wsf.svg"
				alt="Lacuna notation in the Royal Canon of Turin (G41:G36)"
			/> &ndash; <tlit>wsf</tlit> (meaning gap or ‘lacuna’) were present on a vorlage of the papyrus and used where a part of the source text was missing
			or unreadable, including names, dates, or reigns.<button popovertarget="pop30">30</button> A lost lacuna notation for the missing ten kings found
			in the Abydos Canon (41-50) is missing following Netiqerty (5.7), which is corroborated by the lacuna notations in summations 2 (5.15) and 3 (5.16).
			The next immediate names are corrupted, <tlit>nfr-k&#42786; &#7830;rd-snb</tlit> (5.8), <tlit>nfr-k&#42786;</tlit> (5.9), and <tlit>nfr</tlit> (5.10)
			which suggest that there was a larger lacuna in the sources, and the scribe did not realize that the lacuna notation included more than one king.
		</p>
		<p>
			A lacuna notation, presumably for Mentuhotep IV, in the summation of the Eleventh Dynasty (6.18), can only mean that another notation is itself
			lost in lacuna at the end of the entry for Mentuhotep III (6.17). The lacuna notation after <tlit>s&#7723;m-k&#42786;-r&#42788;</tlit> (7.6) account
			for Nerikara, whose name is absent in the king list.<button popovertarget="pop31">31</button> There is a lacuna notation for the number of months
			in the reigns of <tlit>&#42786;w-ib-r&#42788;</tlit> (9.12), and <tlit>sw-wsr-r&#42788;</tlit> (11.8). It is impossible to determine if the notation
			after
			<tlit>nb-sn-r&#42788;</tlit> (9.14) included one or more kings.

		<h2>Corrupted names</h2>
		<p>
			The kings of the Archaic Period did not use a <i>nomen</i> or <i>prenomen</i>, which caused problems in later periods. The solution was to
			assign new names to these ancient kings. The other New Kingdom king lists contain the same names, suggesting canonization at an earlier date,
			however, none of these names is orthographically correct according to contemporary attestations. The changes range from slight to
			unrecognizable. Toward the end of the Archaic Period kings, a lacuna is preserved in the name Hudjefa.<button popovertarget="pop32">32</button> The
			scarce remains of the papyrus make in unclear to what extent corrupted names occurred, especially in the older parts.
		</p>

		<p>
			Some signs were simply misread or erroneously copied by the scribe, resulting in a slightly corrupted name, as can be seen in several places.
			For example, an O29-sign was incorrectly copied as a V30-sign in (9.27), resulting in the name Nebnati, which is a mistake for Anati. It is
			unsurprising and quite expected that there would be several errors in such a long text. The scribe was rather careless at times; several names
			have the sun-disc added after the cartouche open. This was likely done automatically as he wrote the <tlit>nsw-bit</tlit> title, and failed to notice
			his error.<button popovertarget="pop33">33</button>
		</p>

		<p>
			There is evidence to suggest that kings were interchanged on at least one and possibly two occasions. The highest attested year of Pepi I (<tlit
				>mry-r&#42788;</tlit
			>) is 25, and the highest year of Nemtyemsaf I (<tlit>mr.n-r&#42788;</tlit>) is 5. The names in (5.3) and (5.4) are lost, but the years are
			recorded as 20 and 44 respectively, suggesting that the rows were interchanged. Both names use the signs <tlit>mr</tlit> and <tlit
				>r&#42788;</tlit
			>, and the kings were probably simply interchanged by the scribe.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sobkhotep I (7.19) and Wegaf (7.5) would have been recorded more or less across from each other in adjacent columns in <i>Vorlage E</i>. Their
			names share the elements <tlit>&#7717;w, t&#42786;wy</tlit> and <tlit>r&#42788;</tlit>, suggesting that the similar names may have been
			interchanged by the scribe.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is no evidence suggesting that any kings were deliberately omitted from the king list. Prehistoric kings might have been included among
			the &quot;spirits&quot; preceding the historical kings, but since no names are preserved, it will remain unknown. Though there are no imaginary
			kings, Mentuhotep I (6.12) did not adopt royal titles during his lifetime, these were awarded posthumously by his successors. Part of his
			(severely damaged) name is preserved in the Karnak Canon (12), alongside the Horus name <tlit>tpy-&#42788;</tlit>.<button popovertarget="pop34"
				>34</button
			> Neferkasokar (4.1) is unlikely to be historical, as there are no contemporary attestations of his name. Whether the name is fictious, or a false
			etymology of an unidentifiable name remain unknown.<button popovertarget="pop35">35</button>
		</p>
		<p>
			As can be expected, it is impossible to assess the credibility of the reigns attributed in the papyrus. The quality of the sources used to
			compile the reigns are unknown, and as a result, the reliability of the numbers is impossible to quantify. The uncertainty of the reign-lengths
			of even well-attested kings makes assessing the numbers an impossible task. A mathematical error produced at any time during the multiple
			sources, and their copies, could have remained undetected, and impossible to correct.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="py-10">
		<h2>A twelfth column?</h2>
		<p>
			Ryholt suggested that a twelfth column was removed in ancient times; presumably to reuse the blank recto side.<button popovertarget="pop36"
				>36</button
			> This is further corroborated by the fact that sheet 1 is less than half the width of the other papyrus sheets. However, as discussed earlier above,
			the outer sheet of the papyrus roll was likely trimmed <i>before</i> being reused for the king list. It is uncertain whether the king list was a
			direct copy of the information on an older papyrus that needed to be preserved or an updated version that included later kings not present in the
			original.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cut-off part, as per Ryholt, would presumably have held the names of the kings of the Seventeenth through Nineteenth dynasties. The exact
			number is uncertain, probably about 25 (see Table 15, it is obviously unknown how many would have been present in a twelfth column.). Some kings
			of the proposed Abydos Dynasty might also have been present, depending on the number of NK kings, and how elaborate the headings and summations
			were. Adding these kings, or perhaps only some of them, the complete papyrus would have included some 330 rows with close to 250 kings.
		</p>

		<p>
			The estimated number of rulers between the late Second Intermediate Period, from the Seventeenth through the New Kingdom is somewhat uncertain,
			as we do not know the exact number of rulers. The number of kings depends on the Egyptologist consulted, ranging from 8 to 15 for the
			Seventeenth Dynasty alone. Furthermore, the exact succession of the Late Amarna Period is still unclear, the exact number of rulers and their
			positions remain uncertain.

		<h2>Current state of the papyrus</h2>

		<p>
			Apart from the piece cut off in antiquity, the papyrus was presumably intact upon its discovery and only subsequently fell to pieces owing to
			the rough handling. It now consists of more than 300 fragments. Seyffarth pasted the fragments onto <i>papier v&eacute;g&eacute;tal</i> in 1826,
			but this was removed and remounted/reconstructed in 1930 by Hugo Ibscher and Farina also handled the fragments in the subsequent years.<button
				popovertarget="pop37">37</button
			> However, the papyrus suffered evident damage during this process, as can be seen when comparing it to the facsimiles of Lepsius and Wilkinson;
			the photographs shows that numerous fragments were damaged along the edges and that many signs along the edges were lost in the process. This makes
			the facsimiles that more important as they preserve signs that are lost today.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are still a number of important fragments whose exact position has not been established, and numerous smaller fragments, mostly very
			small, have never been published at all. Among the unpublished fragments are parts of royal names of both historical rulers and gods, figures
			relating to reigns of kings, and parts of headings and summations.<button popovertarget="pop38">38</button>
		</p>
		<p>
			In September 2019, the Museo Egizio made high-quality photographs of the papyrus available online.<button popovertarget="pop39">39</button> Unfortunately,
			the photos only show the fragments as arranged by Farina (in three panels), and does <i>not</i> include Gardiner's unplaced fragments, nor any of
			the unpublished ones. Hopefully, these will be added at a later date. Still, these photos (including the recto!) are an incredible improvement over
			the previous photos published by Farina some 80 years ago.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2022, one of the foremost experts in papyrus restoration in the world, <i>Myriam Krutzsch</i> from the Egyptian Museum in Berlin, worked on the
			King List for ten weeks in Turin, where she removed all traces of the previous glue and fabrics used to join the fragile parts together by Seyffarth
			in 1826, and by Ibscher and Farina in the 1930s. The cleaning process showed that many of the numbered fragments were themselves made up of even
			smaller fragments, revealing just how impressive and good Seyffarth's reconstruction of the fragments was.
		</p>

	<div>
		<h2 class="py-5">Inventory number</h2>
		<p>
			The papyrus is descibed in two nineteenth century catalogues of the Museum, and was still considered to be the original document at the time.
			The official Museum inventory number is <b>Cat. 1874</b>, from the 1882 catalogue, though it is often referred to as <b>pTurin 1874</b>.
