	<p class="text-justify">
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.227">227</a>
		The first writer upon whom I shall dwell is one whom I used a little earlier as a witness to our antiquity.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.228">228</a>
		I refer to Manetho. This writer, who had undertaken to translate the history of Egypt from the sacred books, began by stating that our ancestors came
		against Egypt with many tens of thousands and gained the mastery over the inhabitants; and then he himself admitted that at a later date again they
		were driven out of the country, occupied what is now Judaea, founded Jerusalem, and built the temple.&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref81" href="#note81"> 81 </a>
		Up to this point he followed the chronicles:
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.229">229</a>
		thereafter, by offering to record the legends and current talk about the Jews, he took the liberty of interpolating improbable tales in his desire
		to confuse with us a crowd of Egyptians, who for leprosy and other maladies&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref82" href="
#note82
"> 82 </a>
		had been condemned, he says, to banishment from Egypt.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.230">230</a>
		After citing a king Amenôphis, a fictitious person, — for which reason he did not venture to define the length of his reign, although in the case of
		the other kings he adds their years precisely, — Manetho attaches to him certain legends, having doubtless forgotten that according to his own chronicle
		the exodus of the Shepherds to Jerusalem took place 518 years&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref83" href="
#note83
"> 83 </a>
		earlier.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.231">231</a>
		For Tethmôsis was king when they set out; and, according to Manetho, the intervening reigns thereafter occupied 393 years down to the two brothers
		Sethôs and Hermaeus, the former of whom, he says, took the new name of Aegyptus, the latter that of Danaus. Sethôs drove out Hermaeus and reigned for
		59 years; then Rampsês, the elder of his sons, for 66 years.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.232">232</a>
		Thus, after admitting that so many years had elapsed since our forefathers left Egypt, Manetho now interpolates this intruding Amenôphis. This king,
		he states, conceived a desire to behold the gods, as Ôr,&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref84" href="
#note84
"> 84 </a>
		one of his predecessors on the throne, had done; and he communicated his desire to his namesake Amenôphis,&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref85" href="
#note85
"> 85 </a>
		Paapis' son, who, in virtue of his wisdom and knowledge of the future, was reputed to be a partaker in the divine nature.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.233">233</a>
		This namesake, then, replied that he would be able to see the gods if he cleansed the whole land of lepers and other polluted persons.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.234">234</a>
		The king was delighted, and assembled&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref86" href="
#note86
"> 86 </a>
		all those in Egypt whose bodies were wasted by disease: they numbered 80,000 persons.

		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.235">235</a>
		These he cast into the
		<span class="whole">stone-quarries</span>
		&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref87" href="
#note87
"> 87 </a>
		to the east of the Nile, there to work segregated from the rest of the Egyptians. Among them, Manetho adds, there were some of the learned priests,
		who had been attacked by leprosy.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.236">236</a>
		Then this wise seer Amenôphis was filled with dread of divine wrath against himself and the king if the outrage done to these persons should be discovered;
		and he added a prediction that certain allies would join the polluted people and would take possession of Egypt for 13 years. Not venturing to make
		this prophecy himself to the king, he left a full account of it in writing, and then took his own life. The king was filled with despondency.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.237">237</a>
		Then Manetho continues as follows (I quote his account
		<i>verbatim</i>
		): "When the men in the
		<span class="whole">stone-quarries</span>
		had suffered hardships for a considerable time, they begged the king to assign to them as a
		<span class="whole">dwelling-place</span>
		and a refuge the deserted city of the Shepherds, Auaris, and he consented. According to religious tradition&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref88" href="
#note88
"> 88 </a>
		this city was from earliest times dedicated to Typhôn.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.238">238</a>
		Occupying this city and using the region as a base for revolt, they appointed as their leader one of the priests of Hêliopolis called Osarsêph,
		<a class="ref" id="ref89" href="
#note89
"> 89 </a>

		and took an oath of obedience to him in everything.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.239">239</a>
		First of all, he made it a law&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref90" href="
#note90
"> 90 </a>
		that they should neither worship the gods nor refrain from any of the animals&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref91" href="
#note91
"> 91 </a>
		prescribed as especially sacred in Egypt, but should sacrifice and consume all alike, and that they should have intercourse with none save those of
		their own confederacy.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.240">240</a>
		After framing a great number of laws like these, completely opposed to Egyptian custom, he ordered them with their multitude of hands, to repair the
		walls of the city and make ready for war against King Amenôphis.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.241">241</a>
		Then, acting in concert with certain other priests and polluted persons like himself, he sent an embassy to the Shepherds who had been expelled by
		Tethmôsis,&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref92" href="
#note92
"> 92 </a>
		in the city called Jerusalem; and, setting forth the circumstances of himself and his companions in distress, he begged them to unite wholeheartedly
		in an attack upon Egypt.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.242">242</a>
		He offered to conduct them first to their ancestral home at Auaris, to provide their hosts with lavish supplies, to fight on their behalf whenever
		need arose, and to bring Egypt without difficulty under their sway.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.243">243</a>
		Overjoyed at the proposal, all the Shepherds, to the number of 200,000, eagerly set out,

		<a id="p129"><span class="pagenum">p129</span></a>
		and before long arrived at Auaris. When Amenôphis, king of Egypt, learned of their invasion, he was sorely troubled, for he recalled the prediction
		of Amenôphis, son of Paapis.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.244">244</a>
		First, he gathered a multitude of Egyptians; and having taken counsel with the leading men among them, he summoned to his presence the sacred animals
		which were held in greatest reverence in the temples, and gave instructions to each group of priests to conceal the images of the gods as securely
		as possible.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.245">245</a>
		As for his five-year‑old son Rapsês,&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref93" href="
#note93
"> 93 </a>
		he sent him safely away to his friend.&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref94" href="
#note94
"> 94 </a>
		He then crossed the Nile with as many as 300,000 of the bravest warriors of Egypt, and met the enemy. But, instead of joining battle,
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.246">246</a>
		he decided that he must not fight against the gods, and made a hasty retreat to Memphis. There he took into his charge Apis and the other sacred animals
		which he had summoned to that place; and forthwith he set off for Ethiopia&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref95" href="
#note95
"> 95 </a>
		with his whole army and the host of Egyptians. The Ethiopian king, who, in gratitude for a service, had become his subject,
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.247">247</a>
		welcomed him, maintained the whole multitude with such products of the country as were fit for human consumption,

		<a id="p131"><span class="pagenum">p131</span></a>
		assigned to them cities and villages sufficient for the destined period of 13 years' banishment from his realm, and especially stationed an Ethiopian
		army on the frontiers of Egypt to guard King Amenôphis and his followers.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.248">248</a>
		Meanwhile, the Solymites
		<span class="emend">[or dwellers in Jerusalem]</span>
		made a descent along with the polluted Egyptians, and treated the people so impiously and savagely that the domination of the Shepherds seemed like
		a golden age to those who witnessed the present enormities.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.249">249</a>
		For not only did they set towns and villages on fire, pillaging the temples and mutilating images of the gods without restraint, but they also made
		a practice of using the sanctuaries as kitchens to roast the sacred animals which the people worshipped: and they would compel the priests and prophets
		to sacrifice and butcher the beasts, afterwards casting the men forth naked.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.250">250</a>
		It is said that the priest who framed their constitution and their laws was a native of Hêliopolis, named Osarsêph after the god Osiris, worshipped
		at Hêliopolis; but when he joined this people, he changed his name and was called Moses."
		<a class="ref" id="ref96" href="

"> 96 </a>
	</p>

	<p class="text-justify">
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.251">251</a>
		Such, then, are the Egyptian stories about the Jews,&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref97" href="
#note97
"> 97 </a>
		together with many other tales which I pass

		<a id="p133"><span class="pagenum">p133</span></a>
		by for brevity's sake. Manetho adds, however, that, at a later date, Amenôphis advanced from Ethiopia with a large army, his son Rampsês also leading
		a force, and that the two together joined battle with the Shepherds and their polluted allies, and defeated them, killing many and pursuing the others
		to the frontiers of Syria.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.252">252</a>
		This then, with other tales of a like nature, is Manetho's account. Before I give proof that his words are manifest lies and nonsense, I shall mention
		one particular point, which bears upon my later refutation of other writers. Manetho has made one concession to us. He has admitted that our race was
		not Egyptian in origin, but came into Egypt from elsewhere, took possession of the land, and afterwards left it.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.253">253</a>
		But that we were not, at a later time, mixed up with
		<span class="whole">disease-ravaged</span>
		Egyptians, and that, so far from being one of these, Moses, the leader of our people, lived many generations earlier, I shall endeavour to prove from
		Manetho's own statements.
	</p>

	<p class="text-justify">
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.254">254</a>
		To begin with, the reason which he suggests for his fiction is ridiculous. "King Amenôphis," he says, "conceived a desire to see the gods." Gods indeed!
		If he means the gods established by their ordinances, — bull, goat, crocodiles, and dog‑faced baboons, — he had them before his eyes;
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.255">255</a>
		and as for the gods of heaven, how could he see them? And why did he conceive this eager desire? Because, by Zeus,&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref98" href="
#note98
"> 98 </a>
		before his time another king

		<a id="p135"><span class="pagenum">p135</span></a>
		had seen them! From this predecessor, then, he had learned their nature and the manner in which he had seen them, and in consequence he had no need
		of a new system.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.256">256</a>
		Moreover, the prophet by whose aid the king expected to succeed in his endeavour, was a sage. How, then, did he fail to foresee the impossibility of
		realizing this desire? It did, in fact, come to naught. And what reason had he for ascribing the invisibility of the gods to the presence of cripples
		or lepers? Divine wrath is due to impious deeds, not to physical deformities.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.257">257</a>
		Next, how could 80,000 lepers and invalids be gathered together in practically a single day? The prophet had bidden him expel the cripples from Egypt,
		but the king cast them into
		<span class="whole">stone-quarries</span>
		, as if he needed labourers, not as if his purpose was to purge the land.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.258">258</a>
		Manetho says, moreover, that the prophet took his own life, because he foresaw the anger of the gods and the fate in store for Egypt, but left in writing
		his prediction to the king.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.259">259</a>
		Then how was it that the prophet had not from the first foreknowledge of his own death? Why did he not forthwith oppose the king's desire to see the
		gods? Was it reasonable to be afraid of misfortunes which were not to happen in his time? Or what worse fate could have been his than that which he
		hastened to inflict upon himself?
	</p>

	<p class="text-justify">
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.260">260</a>
		But let us now examine&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref99" href="
#note99
"> 99 </a>
		the most ridiculous part

		<a id="p137"><span class="pagenum">p137</span></a>
		of the whole story. Although he had learned these facts, and conceived a dread of the future, the king did not, even then, expel from his land those
		cripples of whose taint he had previously been bidden to purge Egypt, but instead, at their request, he gave them as their city (Manetho says) the
		former habitation of the Shepherds, Auaris, as it was called.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.261">261</a>
		Here, he adds, they assembled, and selected as their leader a man who had formerly been a priest in Heliopolis. This man (according to Manetho) instructed
		them not to worship the gods nor to refrain from the animals revered in Egypt, but to sacrifice and devour them all, and to have intercourse with none
		save those of their own confederacy. Then having bound his followers by oath to abide strictly by these laws, he fortified Auaris and waged war against
		the king.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.262">262</a>
		This leader, Manetho adds, sent to Jerusalem, inviting the people to join in alliance with him, and promising to give them Auaris, which, he reminded
		them, was the ancestral home of those who would come from Jerusalem, and would serve as a base for their conquest of the whole of Egypt.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.263">263</a>
		Then, continues Manetho, they advanced with an army of 200,000 men; and Amenôphis, king of Egypt, thinking he ought not to fight against the gods,
		fled straightway into Ethiopia after enjoining that Apis and some of the other sacred animals should be entrusted to the custody of the priests.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.264">264</a>
		Thereafter, the men from Jerusalem came on, made desolate the cities, burned down the temples, massacred

		<a id="p139"><span class="pagenum">p139</span></a>
		the priests, and, in short, committed every possible kind of lawlessness and savagery.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.265">265</a>
		The priest who framed their constitution and their laws was, according to Manetho, a native of Hêliopolis, Osarsêph by name, after Osiris the god worshipped
		in Hêliopolis: but he changed his name and called himself Moses.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.266">266</a>
		Thirteen years later — this being the destined period of his exile — Amenôphis, according to Manetho, advanced from Ethiopia with a large army, and
		joining battle with the Shepherds and the polluted people, he defeated them, killing many, after pursuing them to the frontiers of Syria.
	</p>

	<p class="text-justify">
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.267">267</a>
		Here again Manetho fails to realize the improbability of his lying tale. Even if the lepers and their accompanying horde were previously angry with
		the king and the others who had treated them thus in obedience to the seer's prediction, certainly when they had left the
		<span class="whole">stone-quarries</span>
		and received from him a city and land, they would have grown more kindly disposed to him.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.268">268</a>
		If indeed they still hated him, they would have plotted against him personally, instead of declaring war against the whole people; for obviously so
		large a company must have had numerous relatives in Egypt.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.269">269</a>
		Notwithstanding, once they had resolved to make war on the Egyptians, they would never have ventured to direct their warfare against their gods, nor
		would they have framed laws completely opposed to the ancestral code under which they had been brought up.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.270">270</a>
		We must, however, be grateful to Manetho for stating that the

		<a id="p141"><span class="pagenum">p141</span></a>
		authors of this lawlessness were not the newcomers from Jerusalem, but that company of people who were themselves Egyptians, and that it was, above
		all, their priests who devised the scheme and bound the multitude by oath.
	</p>

	<p class="text-justify">
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.271">271</a>
		Moreover, how absurd it is to imagine that, while none of their relatives and friends joined in the revolt and shared in the perils of war, these polluted
		persons sent to Jerusalem and gained allies there!
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.272">272</a>
		What alliance, what connexion had previously existed between them? Why, on the contrary, they were enemies, and differed widely in customs. Yet Manetho
		says that they lent a ready ear to the promise that they would occupy Egypt, just as if they were not thoroughly acquainted with the country from which
		they had been forcibly expelled!
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.273">273</a>
		Now, if they had been in straitened or unusual circumstances, they would perhaps have taken the risk; but dwelling, as they did, in a prosperous city
		and enjoying the fruits of an ample country, superior to Egypt, why ever should they be likely to hazard their lives by succouring their former foes,
		those maimed cripples, whom none even of their own kinsfolk could endure? For of course they did not foresee that the king would take flight.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.274">274</a>
		On the contrary, Manetho has himself
		<span class="whole">stated</span>
		that the son&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref100" href="
#note100
"> 100 </a>
		of

		<a id="p143"><span class="pagenum">p143</span></a>
		Amenôphis marched with 300,000 men to confront them at Pêlusium. This was certainly known to those already present; but how could they possibly guess
		that he would charting his mind and flee?
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.275">275</a>
		Manetho next says that, after conquering Egypt, the invaders from Jerusalem committed many heinous crimes; and for these he reproaches them, just as
		if he had not brought them in as enemies, or as if he was bound to accuse allies from abroad of actions which before their arrival native Egyptians
		were performing and had sworn to perform.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.276">276</a>
		But, years later, Amenôphis returned to the attack, conquered the enemy in battle, and drove them, with slaughter, right to Syria. So perfectly easy
		a prey is Egypt to invaders, no matter whence they come!
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.277">277</a>
		And yet those who at that time conquered the land, on learning that Amenôphis was alive, neither fortified the passes between it and Ethiopia, although
		their resources were amply sufficient, nor did they keep the rest of their forces in readiness! Amenôphis, according to Manetho, pursued them with
		carnage over the sandy desert right to Syria. But obviously it is no easy matter for an army to cross the desert even without fighting.
	</p>

	<p class="text-justify">
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.278">278</a>
		Thus, according to Manetho, our race is not of Egyptian origin, nor did it receive any admixture of Egyptians. For, naturally, many of the lepers and
		invalids died in the
		<span class="whole">stone-quarries</span>
		during their long term of hardship, many others in the subsequent battles, and most of all in the final engagement and the rout.
	</p>

	<p class="text-justify" id="p145">
		<span class="pagenum">p145</span>
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.279">279</a>
		It remains for me to reply to Manetho's statements about Moses. The Egyptians regard him as a wonderful, even a divine being, but wish to claim him
		as their own by an incredible calumny, alleging that he belonged to Hêliopolis and was dismissed from his priesthood there owing to leprosy.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.280">280</a>
		The records, however, show that he lived 518 years&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref101" href="#note101"> 101 </a>
		earlier, and led our forefathers up out of Egypt to the land which we inhabit at the present time.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.281">281</a>
		And that he suffered from no such physical affliction is clear from his own words. He has, in fact, forbidden lepers&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref102" href="#note102"> 102 </a>
		either to stay in a town or to make their abode in a village; they must go about in solitude, with their garments rent. Anyone who touches them or
		lives under the same roof with them he considers unclean.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.282">282</a>
		Moreover, even if the malady is cured and the leper resumes normal health, Moses has prescribed certain rites of purification — to cleanse himself
		in a bath of
		<span class="whole">spring-water</span>
		and to shave off all his hair, — and enjoins the performance of a number of different sacrifices before entrance into the holy city.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.283">283</a>
		Yet it would have been natural, on the contrary, for a victim of this scourge to show some consideration and kindly feeling for those who shared the
		same misfortune.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.284">284</a>
		It was not only about lepers that he framed such laws: those who had even the slightest mutilation of the body were disqualified for the priesthood;&#8288;
		<a class="ref" id="ref103" href="#note103"> 103 </a>
		and if a priest in the course of his ministry met with an

		<a id="p147"><span class="pagenum">p147</span></a>
		accident of this nature, he was deprived of his office.
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.285">285</a>
		How improbable, then, that Moses should be so foolish as to frame these laws, or that men brought together by such misfortunes should approve of legislation
		against themselves, to their own shame and injury!
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.286">286</a>
		But, further, the name, too, has been transformed in an extremely improbable way. According to Manetho, Moses was called Osarsêph. These names, however,
		are not interchangeable: the true name means "one saved out of the water," for water is called "
		<span class="Egyptian">mō‑y</span>
		" by the Egyptians.
		<a class="ref" id="ref104" href="

	</p>

	<p class="text-justify">
		<a class="sec" name="Fragment_54.287">287</a>
		It is now, therefore, sufficiently obvious, I think, that, so long as Manetho followed the ancient records, he did not stray far from the truth; but
		when he turned to unauthorized legends, he either combined them in an improbable form or else gave credence to certain prejudiced informants.

			of the Two Lands," as its Egyptian name means. Thus the kings of Dynasty XII are kings who came from Thebes, but ruled at Dahshûr.

		<p class="text-justify" id="p67x">
			In Dynasty XII the conquests of Dynasty VI in the south were extended; and Sesôstris III was the first Egyptian king to conquer Syria. Among

			<span class="whole">Caton-Thompson</span>
			and E. W. Gardner,
			<i>The Desert Fayûm</i>
			, 1934.) Manetho mentions his building of the Labyrinth; it is significant that after the reign of Sesôstris III and his wide foreign conquests,
			his son should have built the Labyrinth. Vases of the Kamares type from Crete have been found at Kahûn, not far from the Labyrinth.

			in Upper Egypt (Dynasty XVII of Manetho).
		</p>

		<p class="text-justify">
			In the Turin Papyrus there is a long series of rulers' names corresponding to this dynasty; but the number given by Manetho (76) was not
			approximated in the Papyrus which shows between twenty and thirty names of kings. Not one of these names is preserved on the Monuments, nor on
			the Karnak Tablet. The kings of Dynasty XIV, and even the last kings of Dynasty XIII, reigned simultaneously with the Hyksôs kings:
			<i>cf.</i>
			the double series of kings in Dynasty XVII. In the Royal Lists of Abydos and Sakkâra the rulers of Dynasties XIII‑XVII are altogether omitted. The

			<a class="note" id="note12" href="#ref12">12</a>
			The invasion of the Hyksôs took place at some time in Dynasty XIII: hence the succeeding anarchy in a period of foreign domination. The later Egyptians
			looked back upon it as the Jews did upon the Babylonian captivity, or the English upon the Danish terror. The keen desire of the Egyptians to forget
			about the Hyksôs usurpation accounts in part for our ignorance of what actually happened: "it is with apparent unwillingness that they chronicle
			any events connected with it" (Peet,
			<i>Egypt and the Old Testament</i>
			, p69). In Egyptian texts the "infamous" (Hyksôs) were denoted as
			<span class="Egyptian">ꜤAmu</span>
			, a title also given to the Hittites and their allies by Ramessês II in the poem of the Battle of Kadesh (ed. Kuentz, § 97). Perhaps they were combined
			with Hittites who in 1925
			<span class="small">B.C.</span>
			brought the kingdom of Babel to an end. It is certain that with the Hyksôs numerous Semites came into Egypt: some of the Hyksôs kings have Semitic
			names. For the presence of an important Hurrian element among the Hyksôs, see E. A. Speiser, "Ethnic Movements," in
			<i>Ann. of Amer. Sch. of Or. Res.</i>
			<span class="small">XIII</span>
			(1932), p51. The

			<a id="p77x"></a>
			Hyksôs brought with them from Asia their tribal god, which was assimilated by the Egyptian to Sêth, the god of foreign parts, of the desert, and
			of the enemy.

		<p class="text-justify">
			In the first half of the second millennium
			<span class="small">B.C.</span>
			the Hyksôs ruled a great kingdom in Palestine and Syria (Meyer,
			<i>Geschichte</i>
			<span class="superscript">5</span>
			,
			<span class="small">I</span>
			§ 304); and when their power was broken down by the arrival of hostile tribes, King Amôsis took advantage of their plight to drive the Hyksôs out
			of Egypt (A. Jirku, "Aufstieg und Untergang der Hyksôs," in
			<i>Journ. of the Palestine Orient. Soc.</i>
