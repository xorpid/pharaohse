			The tallest <a href="/obelisks">obelisk</a> in Egypt (29.5 m, 97 ft) is in Temple of Amun at the Great Temple complex at Karnak and was erected by
			<a href="/pharaohs/Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a> who was a female pharaoh of Egypt in 1473–1458 BCE. Its catalogued as Karnak
			<em>Obelisk E</em> and was the northernmost of a pair. The southern obelisk, <i>Obelisk F</i>, had already fallen by antiquity. The cause is
			uncertain, but it may have been due to an earthquake or a build-up of stress from a small crack that widened. Thutmose III had both obelisks
			enclosed by false walls, rendering them practically invisible from inside the temple as part of the <dfn class="color-1">damnatio memoriae</dfn
			>, whereby her successors systematically erased her name from public records and monuments..
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2022 the top part of the toppled <i>Obelisk F</i> (11 m, 36 ft tall) was erected by the Sacred Lake at the side of the Great temple, where it
			had been lying on its side for decades. The the damaged base is still in the original location, the new location is <i>not</i> the original spot
			for the obelisk, but it is at least in line with its twin. Parts of the central columns were erased and usurped first by Thutmose III and later by
			Seti I. It is possible that the obelisk was deliberately toppled to erase the memory of Hatshepsut, but its fall caused such destruction that the
			other obelisk was left standing to avoid further damage to the temple. The base remains inside the temple at the original position. The remaining
			parts of the base text is <i>not</i> an exact copy of the standing obelisk, and three of the faces of the toppled obelisk have been usurped/altered.
			The fate of the other pair of her obelisks is unknown; they were probably toppled and dismantled by her successors.

		<p>
			The Living Horus: Mighty of ka's; the Two Ladies: Flourishing-in-years; Horus of Gold: Divine-of-diadems; the Dual King: Maatkara; Daughter of
			Ra: Hatshepsut, united with Amun, who lives forever. The daughter of Amun-Ra, his beloved, his only one who came from him; shining image of the
			Lord-of-all; whose beauty was fashioned by the powers of <i title="i.e. Heliopolis in the delta">On</i>; who holds the Two Lands like her maker;
			whom he created to wear his diadems; who has forms like Khepri, who rises like Harakhty; pure egg, splendid seed, whom the Two Magicians nursed;
			whom Amun himself made appear upon the throne of <i title="i.e. Thebes">Southern On</i>; whom he chose as guardian of Egypt, as protector of
			nobles and commoners. The Horus who championed her father, the eldest of Kamutef; whom Ra begot so as to have beneficent offspring on earth, for
			the well-being of mankind. His living image, the Dual King, Maatkara, the fine gold of kings.
		</p>
		<p>
			She made as her monument for her father Amun, Lord of Thrones-of-the-Two-Lands, presiding over <i title="The Great Temple at Karnak">Ipet-sut</i
			>, the making for him of two great obelisks of hard granite of the South, their upper side being of electrum, of the best of all foreign lands.
			Seen on both sides of the river, their rays flood the Two Lands when Aten dawns between them, as he rises in heaven's lightland.
		</p>

		<p class="p-10 italic">
			I have done this from a loving heart for my father Amun; initiated in his secret of the beginning, acquainted with his beneficient might, I did
			not forget anything he had ordained.<br />
			My Majesty knows his divinity, I acted under his command; It was he who led me, I did not plan any works without his doing.<br />
			It was he who gave directions, I did not sleep because of his temple, I did not stray from that which he commanded.<br />
			My heart was wise before my father, I entered into the plans of his heart.<br />
			I did not turn my back on the city of the All-Lord, rather did I turn my face to it.<br />
			I know that Ipet-sut is the horizon on earth, the august hill of the beginning, The Sacred Eye of the All-Lord, His favored place that bears his
			beauty, that gathers in his followers.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is the King himself who says: I declare before the people who shall be in the future, who shall observe the monument I made for my father,
			who shall speak in discussion, who shall look to posterity&ndash;it was when I sat in the palace, and thought of my maker, that my heart led me
			to make for him two obelisks of electrum, whose summits would reach the heavens, in the august hall of, between the two great portals of the
			King, the mighty bull, the Dual King, <i title="Thutmose I">Aakheperkara</i>, the Horus triumphant. Now, my heart [<i
				>turns to and fro, in thinking what will the people say, they who</i
			>] shall see my monument after years, and who shall speak of what I have done.
		</p>

		<p class="p-10 italic">
			Beware of saying, &quot;I know not, I know not: Why has this been done? To fashion a mountain of gold throughout, like something that just
			happened.&quot;<br />
			I swear, as I am loved of Ra,<br />
			As Amun, my father, favors me,<br />
			As my nostrils are refreshed with life and dominion,<br />
			As I wear the white crown,<br />
			As I appear in the red crown,<br />
			As Horus and Set have joined their portions for me,<br />
			As I rule this land like the son of Isis,<br />
			As I am mighty like the son of Nut,<br />
			As Ra rests in the evening barque,<br />
			As he prevails in the morning barque,<br />
			As he joins his two mothers in the divine barque,<br />
			As sky endures, as his creation lasts,<br />
			As I shall be eternal like an undying star,<br />
			As I shall rest in life like Atum&ndash;<br />
		</p>

		<p>
			So as regard these two great obelisks, wrought with electrum by my majesty for my father Amun, in order that my name may endure in this temple,
			for eternity and everlastingness, they are each of one block of hard granite, without seam, without joining together!<br /><br />
			My majesty began work on them in year 15, second month of winter, day 1, ending in year 16, fourth month of summer, last day, totalling seven months
			of quarry work. I did it for him out of affection, as a king for a god. It was my wish to make them for him gilded with electrum. &quot;Their &ndash;
			on their body&quot; is what I expect people to say. My mouth is effective in its speech; I do not go back on my word. Hear ye! I gave for them of
			the finest electrum. I measured it by the heket like sacks of grain. My majesty summoned a quantity beyond what the Two Lands had yet seen. The ignorant
			and the wise know it.<br /><br />
			Not shall he who hears it say, &quot;It is a boast,&quot; what I have said; rather say, &quot;How like her it is, she is devoted to her father!&quot;<br
			/>
			Lo, the god knows me well, Amun, Lord of Thrones of the Two Lands; he made me rule the Black Land and Red Land as reward.<br />
			No one rebels against me in all lands. All foreign lands are my subjects, he placed my border at the limits of heaven.<br />
			What Aten encirdes labors for me. He gave it to him who came from him, knowing I would rule it for him. I am his daughter in very truth.<br />
			Who serves him, who knows what he ordains. My reward from my father is life-stability-rule.<br />
			On the Horus throne of all the living, eternally like Ra.<br />
