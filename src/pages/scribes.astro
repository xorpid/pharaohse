			Scribes underwent formal education in specialized schools that focused on teaching reading, writing, mathematics, and other skills necessary for
			administrative and clerical tasks. The training was rigorous and involved a long period of education, typically starting at a young age. These
			schools were often associated with temples or administrative centres, where the scribes received training under the guidance of experienced
			teachers. The ability to read and write hieratic, and to some degree hieroglyphs, as well as mastering the complex administrative and legal
			scripts was crucial for scribes working in civil service offices.
		</p>

		<p class="pt-5">
			Temples were significant centres of education and administration in ancient Egypt. Scribes were closely associated with temple activities, as
			they played a key role in recording religious rituals, managing temple finances, and maintaining sacred texts. They participated in the
			production and preservation of religious literature, including hymns, prayers, and magical spells. Writing was almost entirely made on <a
				href="/papyrus">papyrus</a
			> rolls.
		</p>

		<p>
			Employed in various governmental offices and administrative centres, they were responsible for maintaining records related to taxation, land
			ownership, legal matters, and other administrative functions. Scribes were held in high esteem in ancient Egyptian society, and their work was
			considered prestigious and essential for the functioning of the state and religious institutions. Sons of scribes inherited their fathers’ civic
			position.

			The Egyptians wrote with a brush made from the stem of a rush called <i>Juncus maritimus</i>, which still thrives in Egypt’s saline marshes.

			Scribes in the royal courts played essential roles in documenting royal decrees, managing correspondence, and maintaining records of the
			pharaoh’s activities. The highest-ranking scribes might have had the privilege of serving the pharaoh directly and participating in the
			administration of the kingdom. While most scribes served in institutional settings, some were employed in private households, especially by
			individuals who required assistance with correspondence, legal matters, or other administrative tasks. The military also required scribes, where
			they kept military records, documenting campaigns, and managing logistics.
		</p>

		<p>
			There were also workshops where copies of texts were produced. These workshops were responsible for creating multiple copies of religious and
			literary texts, contributing to the dissemination of knowledge. Some larger institutions, such as temple complexes, may have had libraries where
			scribes could access and study a wide range of texts.
		</p>

		<h2 class="py-4">Human error in manuscripts</h2>
		<p>
			Human error is a significant factor contributing to the potential corruption of any hand-written manuscript. The scribes responsible for copying
			texts in ancient times were skilled individuals, but they were not immune to error. <i lang="la">Errare humanum est.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			Copying texts by hand is a labour-intensive and meticulous process. In the course of copying, there are many ways errors could be introduced,
			such as skipping lines, omitting words, or duplicating phrases. These mistakes, though unintentional, could create variations among different
			manuscript copies. Scribes might encounter difficulties in understanding the content of the text they were copying, especially if it was written
			in an unfamiliar language or used archaic expressions. Misinterpretations could lead to the introduction of errors as the scribe attempted to
			make sense of the original material.
		</p>
		<p>
			Scribes might inadvertently substitute one word for another due to phonetic or visual similarity, leading to semantic changes in the text.
			Different schools or individual scribes often had their own conventions, leading to inconsistencies both within a single manuscript and between
			different copies of the same text. <em>Dittography</em> occurs when a scribe unintentionally repeats a sequence of letters or words. <em
				>Haplography</em
			>, on the other hand, is the accidental omission of a repeated letter or word. Both phenomena can alter the intended meaning of a sentence or
			passage.
		</p>

			Copying texts by hand often introduce errors
		</div>

		<p>
			Skipping lines or repeating portions of text due to a momentary lapse of attention or visual oversight is also possible, leading to the
			introduction of inaccuracies or omissions in the copy. Fatigue, especially when working for extended periods, could lead to a decline in
			concentration and an increased likelihood of making errors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sometimes mistakes were noticed after completing a portion of the manuscript and attempts to correct them could introduce new errors or lead to
			inconsistencies in the text. Words were often abbreviated to save time and space. However, misinterpretation or misapplication of these
			abbreviations could result in errors, especially if there were variations in the conventions used by different scribes or regions.
		</p>
		<p>
			When later scribes copied existing manuscripts, they might introduce errors while transcribing the text. These errors could compound over
			successive copies, leading to further corruption.
		</p>
		<p>
			Understanding the potential for human error is crucial for scholars engaged in textual criticism, a field that aims to reconstruct the most
			accurate version of a text by comparing different manuscript copies and identifying variations. This process helps researchers discern the
			original wording and meaning of a text despite the inevitable errors introduced by scribes throughout history. As usual, non-professionals
			without specialized knowledge can only marvel at the skills of the professionals.
		</p>

		<p>
			It’s important to note that the study of ancient manuscripts involves careful consideration of these potential sources of corruption. Scholars
			and historians use various techniques, such as textual criticism, to identify and correct errors, understand the context, and reconstruct the
			most accurate version of the original text.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <i>codex format</i> refers to a type of book characterized by pages bound together on one side, forming a more book-like structure compared to
			the scroll. While the widespread adoption of the codex format occurred later, during the late Roman and early Christian periods, its roots can be
			traced back to antiquity.
		</p>

		<p>
			Many documents from the ancient Greek, Ptolemaic and Roman worlds survive only <i>in epitome</i>, the practice of writing condensed versions of
			larger works. Epitomists may have attempted to preserve the spirit of the original, but as with all secondary sources, a different bias may be
			introduced, along with the addition of details or anecdotes not present in the original. It also works in the other direction, as important
			facts may have been changed or omitted, whether by design or error.
		</p>

		<p class="text-black dark:text-amber-50 mx-24">
			Anyone who writes knows that errors are almost inevitable. This is particularly true when copying text; even modern copy-and-paste functions are
			not immune to introducing errors.
