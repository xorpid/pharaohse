				<i>The Bible</i> only mention the names of four minor pharaohs of the Late Period, otherwise the kings of Egypt are simply known as <em
					>Pharaoh</em
				>. In antiquity, Greek historians who visited Egypt encountered the names of kings from that country which were unknown to them. They
				attempted to approximate these names into Greek, but the resulting transcriptions were not entirely accurate, as might be expected.

				<a href="/ancient-egypt/kinglist/manetho">Manetho</a>, an Egyptian priest who flourished in the first half of the third century BC, is the
				principal source for the <a href="/ancient-egypt/chronology">chronology of ancient Egypt</a>. He composed <em>Aegyptiaca</em>, "The History of
				Egypt," by combining material from the sacred temple archives with popular traditions, legends, and narratives. The majority of the names
				currently in use for pharaohs originate from Manetho, or more specifically, from quotations preserved by historians writing several centuries
				later. <a href="/ancient-egypt/kinglist/manetho-king-list">Manetho's dynasties</a> established the fundamental chronology of ancient Egypt.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is inevitable that errors and corruption will occur in subsequent copies over the centuries. These may range from simple misunderstandings
				of the text to outright alterations and omissions. The names that had been preserved by Manetho were widely recognised and constituted the
				initial point of reference for Champollion when he embarked upon deciphering of the cartouches of kings. The second half of the nineteenth
				century saw the advent of the new science of Egyptology and the gradual revelation of the original names of the pharaohs.

					The Greek historian Herodotus visited Egypt during the 27th Dynasty, when it was under Persian domination. His <em>Histories</em> is the earliest
					known work to use the actual royal names rather than the generic term ‘pharaoh’. As a chronological work, however, it is of little value: for
					instance, he placed kings of the Old Kingdom <i>after</i> the New Kingdom. Although his work is often unreliable, Herodotus provides a detailed
					account of ancient Egypt and offers anecdotal insights into the lives of numerous pharaohs, some of whom are composites of multiple kings. He
					also references the priests claim that there had been around 330 kings in total.

				<p>
					The Egyptian priest Manetho wrote <em>Aegyptiaca</em>, also known as the ‘History of Egypt’, which covered all the pharaohs up to the time
					of Alexander the Great's conquest. During the first centuries CE, knowledge of how to read hieroglyphs gradually declined and was completely
					lost by the time Western Rome fell in 476. Thanks to the early historians who transcribed extracts from the Aegyptiaca, the Greek
					approximations of the original names of the pharaohs were preserved, as was the chronology and division of the long line of pharaohs into
					dynasties. This chronology was the most complete available on the pharaohs. Although it is far from perfect, much of it has been
					corroborated by archaeological findings, and the division into dynasties is still in use today.

					travelled to Alexandria and Egypt to further his education. Although the date of composition of the essay is unknown, it is generally
					thought to have been written after his visit. He makes no mention of a list of kings.

					“Universal History” covering the period from the birth of Abraham to his own time. While the original Greek volumes are lost, quotations
					preserved by later authors make it possible to reconstruct most of the work. In the second book, the “Canons”, Eusebius revolutionised

					An updated Latin translation of the second book of Eusebius’ (the Canons) known as the <em>Chronicle of Jerome</em> was created by Christian
					priest and historian <i>Jerome of Stridon</i> around 382. Jerome updated or extended the timeline from where Eusebius left off, adding events

					1822. He used the Rosetta Stone inscriptions and his methodical study of demotic and hieratic from previous years to finally be able to
					decipher the hieroglyphs. The discovery opened the way to the reading of a wide range of texts on monuments and papyri, and it can be said
					that the field of Egyptology was born.
