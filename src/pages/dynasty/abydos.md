<p class="lead">
The Abydos Dynasty, or Thinite Dynasty is believed to have been contemporaneous with the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Dynasties, from approximately 1650 to 1600 BC. 
</p>

It is hypothesised that this was a relatively short-lived local dynasty that ruled over parts of Middle and Upper Egypt, around Abydos and the yet-to-be-discovered Thinis, during the <i>Second Intermediate Period</i> in Egypt. There is no mention of this dynasty in Manetho's writings.

<h2 class="mt-10">The chronological order</h2>

It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties. The <i>Second Intermediate Period</i> dynasties are the subject of significant ongoing research, and could see dramatic changes in the future.
