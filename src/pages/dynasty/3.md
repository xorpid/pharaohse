The <a href="/periods/old-kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> was a period of internal stability and prosperity for the kingdom that lasted about five centuries. During this time, the king became a living god, ruling with absolute authority. Memphis replaced Thinis as the capital, and a large number of pyramids were built nearby as burial places for the kings.</p>
<p>
The line of succession is not entirely clear as the evidence is scarce and contains conflicting information, making it very difficult even to associate the various names with a particular king. There is some evidence that a civil war broke out towards the end of this dynasty. The reigns of the kings are poorly documented, but Djoser is thought to be the first king of the Third Dynasty, mainly because he buried Khasekhemwy, the last king of the Second Dynasty.
</p><p>
Dating the dynasty is difficult and the only figures available are those found in column 4 of the <a href="/kinglists/turin/column-4">Turin King List</a>, which was written some 1,500 years after the fact (see Table 2 below).

<h2 class="mt-10">The chronological order</h2>
<p>
It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.

<h2 class="mt-10 text-wrap">The Third Dynasty according to <a href="/authors">Manetho</a></h2>

<p class="pb-6">
	Africanus provides details for nine kings of the Third Dynasty, but Eusebius only for two, dismissing the remaining six as insignificant.
	The nine kings of Africanus do not agree with the archaeological record, nor with the major New Kingdom canons, which contain only 4-5 kings with conflicting names. Moreover, they reigned for less than 100 years, not the seemingly inflated totals of Africanus and Eusebios. It is evident that the older records were already incomplete or corrupted in the later parts of the Old Kingdom, as the surviving details are very sparse and contradictory.

	The king list does not agree on the number, nor the names, suggesting incomplete records used by the New Kingdom creators of these lists. The <a href="/kinglists/abydos-canon">Abydos Canon</a> and <a href="/kinglists/turin">Turin King List</a> contain five, and the <a href="/kinglists/saqqara-canon">Saqqara Canon</a> only four.
