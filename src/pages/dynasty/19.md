Also known as the <i>Ramesside dynasty</i>, the Nineteenth Dynasty continued the legacy of the New Kingdom with military conquests and impressive architectural projects, Ramesseum and Abu Simbel are prime examples of this grandeur.

Founded by Vizier Ramesses I, whom Horemheb chose as his successor to the throne, he only enjoyed kingship for little more than a year. His son Seti I took over. Seti's main priority was to reassert Egypt's sovereignty over territories that had been threatened by increasing Hittite pressure. He reconquered most of the disputed territories for Egypt. Back home, he embarked on ambitious building projects across Egypt, but his untimely death put a halt to that.
</p>
<p>
His son, Rameses II, would complete and expand his father's projects. He is unequalled in the number of buildings and monuments he has constructed, and would go on to rule the kingdom for 66 years. After the death of Ramesses II, his already 70-year-old son Merneptah took over. After only a few years, he too died, and power struggles erupted between Merneptah's heirs. Amenmesse usurped the throne from Merneptah's designated son and successor, Seti II. However, he only lasted four years before Seti regained power and destroyed most of Amenmesse's monuments.

<h2 class="mt-10">The chronological order</h2>
<p>
It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.
