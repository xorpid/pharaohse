<p class="lead">
History is full of fascinating mysteries, and ancient Egypt has its fair share. Among them are the unplaceable pharaohs - rulers whose reigns and identities remain shrouded in mystery. Whether controversial or completely unknown, archaeologists and historians alike tries to unlock their secrets.

<h3 class="shine">The chronological order is unknown/uncertain</h3>

It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.
