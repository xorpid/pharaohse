<p>Pharaoh Hotepsekhemwy re-united the kingdom and founded the Second Dynasty. The history of the Second Dynasty is challenging to interpret due to the lack of available evidence. While some kings are confirmed by physical evidence, such as tombs and artefacts, others are only known through their names. The Second Dynasty represents a transition period between the establishment of a central government in the First Dynasty and the consolidation in the Third Dynasty.</p>
<p>In the final years of Ninetjer's reign, a series of events occurred that precipitated a period of instability within the kingdom. It is established that he divided the kingdom into two parts, but the rationale behind this decision remains unclear. Following his demise, the realm was beset by competing factions vying for authority or even establishing their own rulers. The precise sequence of events that transpired remains uncertain; however, three principal hypotheses have been proposed to shed light on the circumstances surrounding the conclusion of Ninetjer's rule.</p>
<ol class="list-inside px-20 text-justify py-3">
	<li class="py-3">The <i>first</i> hypothesis suggests that a political breakdown and religious conflict may have precipitated the crisis.</li>
	<li class="py-3">The <i>second</i> hypothesis suggests that Ninetjer may have deliberately chosen to divide Egypt between his two successors, possibly his sons, in order to better administer the two separate kingdoms.</li>
	<li class="py-3">The <i>third</i> hypothesis suggests that an economic collapse, perhaps caused by famine, may have constituted a significant factor in the emergence of disunity within the Egyptian population.</li>
</ol>

<p>The historical record pertaining to the later stages of the dynasty is, at best, obscure, as evidenced by the inconsistencies in the various king lists. Khasekhemwy, the last pharaoh of the dynasty, was responsible for the initiation of numerous construction projects throughout Egypt and was the father of <a href="/pharaohs/Djoser">Djoser</a>, who is regarded as the founder of the Third Dynasty.</p>

<h2 class="mt-10">The chronological order</h2>

<p>It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.</p>

<h2 class="mt-10 text-wrap">The Second Dynasty according to <a href="/authors/manetho">Manetho</a></h3>

<p class="pb-6">The nine kings are the same number as in the Turin king list, although the Abydos Canon only has six, while the Saqqara Canon has eight. The individual reigns of Africanus add up to 302 years, while Eusebius’ total adds to 297. When combining the first and second dynasties of Africanus, Syncellus calculated a total of 555 years (253 + 302). However, this is incorrect; the actual total is 565 years (263 + 302) due to the 10-year discrepancy in the First Dynasty. For Eusebius, he correctly give the combined total of 549 years (252 + 297).</p>
