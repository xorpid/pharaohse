Traces have been found of a number of predynastic kings of ancient Egypt, many of whom may have been local rulers of small towns. There is an increase in trade and the first signs of centralisation, including the use of simple hieroglyphs. This period is marked by the emergence of large cities and political consolidation eventually leading to the transition to dynastic rule. Small city-states sprang up along the Nile and, as always, the city-states fought each other for centuries. Eventually the armies of Thinis in Upper Egypt defeated the other nearby cities and then moved downstream to conquer Lower Egypt. Victorious, King Narmer united the two lands and became the first to rule all of Egypt.

<h2 class="mt-10 text-wrap">The Predynastic kings according to <a href="/authors">Manetho</a></h3>

Neither Africanus nor Eusebius preserve any predynastic names or dates. According to Syncellus, the <a href="/authors/syncellus">Book of Sothis</a> was written by Manetho, though modern scholars consider it a much later forgery, and it only names Gods and demigods.
