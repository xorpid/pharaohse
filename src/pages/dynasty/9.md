	The fact that the two dynasties of the Heracleopolitans, according to Manetho, contain the name of only one king suggests that there is a <i>lacuna</i> or gap in the record. There was probably some indication that the records had been corrupted or lost, which the epitomators mistook for another dynasty.<br /><br />The difference in the number of kings and years between Africanus and Eusebius for dynasties 9 and 10 is another clear indication that their epitomes differed substantially. The summation for the Ninth/Tenth Dynasties in the <i>Turin King List</i> lists 18 kings,<button popovertarget="pop01">1</button> however the names of most of them are also missing. These 18 kings are recorded as an unbroken sequence of kings without a dynastic break, as is often the case in this king list.

<h2 class="mt-10">The chronological order</h2>
<p>
It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.

<p class="pb-6">
As can be seen from the differences between the more complete text of Africanus and the missing information in Eusebius's account of the earlier dynasties, the contents of their epitomes of Aegyptiaca must have been quite different. However, this does not necessarily indicate which text is more accurate.
