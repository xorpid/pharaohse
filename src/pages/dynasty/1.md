<p><em>The First Dynasty</em> represents the initial period of unified Egyptian rule under the first local kings. This period immediately follows the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, which is thought to have been achieved by King <a href="/pharaohs/Narmer">Narmer</a>, and marks the beginning of Egyptian historical times. The centre of power was located in the city of Thinis.<br />Only a limited number of details pertaining to this dynasty have survived. The majority of the kings' tombs were constructed using wood, with only a small proportion incorporating stone for the walls and floors. It is possible that human sacrifice formed part of the early funerary ceremonies, as numerous smaller tombs were discovered in close proximity to those of the kings.</p>

<img class="w-full rounded-sm sm:rounded-xl my-10" src="/images/dyn1.webp" alt="Dynasty 1">

<p>This period laid the foundation for the powerful dynasties to follow. While characterized by significant advancements in administration and culture, the First Dynasty was also a time of establishing royal power and authority, setting the stage for the monumental achievements of the <a href="/periods/old-kingdom">Old Kingdom</a>. The lack of detailed records from this period presents a significant challenge to the accurate reconstruction of specific events and timelines. Furthermore, the dates of the dynasty are also a matter of a debate that is unlikely to ever be fully resolved. It can be placed relatively safely within the 3100–2900 BC time frame.</p>
 
<h2 class="mt-10">The chronological order</h2>
<p>
It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.

<h2 class="mt-10 text-wrap">The First Dynasty according to <a href="/authors">Manetho</a></h2>

<p>Manetho is traditionally regarded as the inventor of the system of dividing Egyptian kings into <a href="/dynasties">dynasties</a>. These records have survived for more than two millennia, and they have been preserved through the inclusion of excerpts from other ancient authors. Nevertheless, the length of reigns presented lack any form of corroboration from other sources.</p>
<p>However, the records of Africanus and Eusebius differ in the length of reign of the first four kings, while they agree on the last four. Conversely, the names of the first four kings agree in both accounts, but the last four are slightly different. It is evident that there has been some form of corruption in the epitomes used by both authors, albeit at different points. It is impossible to say which account is more accurate.</p>

<p class="pt-2 ps-3 text-justify italic">
	<mid>2.4</mid> The first human king of Egypt was Min. In his time all Egypt save the Thebaic province was a marsh: all the country that we now see was then covered by water, north of the lake Moeris, a lake seven days' journey up the river from the sea.
</p>
<p class="pt-2 ps-3 font-normal text-justify italic">
	<mid>2.99</mid> The priests told me that Min was the first king of Egypt, and that first he separated Memphis from the Nile by a dam. All the river had flowed close under the sandy mountains on the Libyan side, but Min made the southern bend of it, which begins about twelve and one half miles above Memphis, by damming the stream, thereby drying up the ancient channel, and carried the river by a channel so that it flowed midway between the hills. Then, when this first king Min had made dry land of what he thus cut off, he first founded in it that city which is now called Memphis, and outside of it he dug a lake from the river to its north and west; and secondly, he built in it the great and most noteworthy temple of Hephaestus [Ptah].<br />After him came 330 kings, whose names the priests recited from a papyrus roll. In all these many generations there were eighteen Ethiopian kings, and one queen, native to the country; the rest were all Egyptian men.

	was more than 1,300 years, were called Pharaohs, and took it from one Pharaoh that lived after the Kings of that interval, I think it necessary
	to inform them of it: and this in order to cure their ignorance, and to make the occasion of that name manifest. Pharaoh in the Egyptian tongue
	signifies a King. But I suppose they made use of other names from their childhood: but when they were made Kings, they changed them into the
	name which in their own tongue denoted their authority ..... I suppose also that Herodotus of Halicarnassus, when he said there were 330 Kings
	of Egypt after Menes, who built Memphis, did therefore not tell us their names, because they were in common called Pharaohs ..... As for myself,
	I have discovered from our own Books, that after Pharaoh, the father-in-law of Solomon, no other King of Egypt did any longer use that name.....
