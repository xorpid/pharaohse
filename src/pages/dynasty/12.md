<p class="lead">
The Twelfth Dynasty is considered to be the last dynasty of the Old Kingdom. According to Manetho, they ruled from Memphis, and since their pyramids were built nearby at Saqqara, this seems very plausible.

The Twelfth Dynasty witnessed a series of significant developments in Egypt, including the restructuring of the kingdom's administration and innovative agricultural practices. Military campaigns expanded the Egyptian borders, advancing into Nubia and the Levant. According to Manetho's records, the Twelfth Dynasty was based in Thebes. Nevertheless, contemporary historical records indicate that Amenemhat I relocated the capital to a new city. Itjtawy. Despite extensive archaeological exploration, the city has yet to be discovered. It seems probable that it was located in the vicinity of the Fayyum, possibly merely a royal residence.

<h2 class="mt-10">The chronological order</h2>

It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.

<p>As can be seen from the differences between the more complete text of Africanus and the missing information in Eusebius's account of the earlier dynasties, the contents of their epitomes of Aegyptiaca must have been quite different. However, this does not necessarily indicate which text is more accurate.</p>

<p>
	In their respective accounts, Africanus and Eusebius identified seven kings who were part of the Twelfth Dynasty. While Africanus provides the names of all seven, Eusebius only name the first four. This suggests that the epitome used by Africanus was more comprehensive, although it is possible that Eusebius simply omitted the remaining three kings for some reason.
</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, the total number of years attributed to the dynasty by Eusebius (245) differs from the sum of the listed kings (182). These discrepancies provide further evidence that the epitome used by Eusebius was not an accurate representation of the original source material. It is possible that the epitomist was unaware that Manetho's original narrative included not only four kings named Amenemmes, but also three kings named Sesostris, resulting in the similar names being dismissed by the epitomist.

	<mid>2.102</mid> After returning thence back to Egypt, he [Sesostris] gathered a great army (according to the story of the priests) and marched over the mainland, subduing every nation to which he came. When those that he met were valiant men and strove hard for freedom, he set up pillars in their land whereon the inscription showed his own name and his country's, and how he had overcome them with his own power; but when the cities had made no resistance and been easily taken, then he put an inscription on the pillars even as he had done where the nations were brave; but he drew also on them the privy parts of a woman, wishing to show clearly that the people were cowardly.
