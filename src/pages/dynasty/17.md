<p>Opposition to Hyksos rule began when the last kings of the dynasty exchanged insults, leading to skirmishes, but soon escalated into full-scale war. King Seqenenra was killed in the conflict, and his son Kamose continued and escalated the war, punishing all those who had collaborated with the foreigners.<br />It all culminated in the defeat and expulsion of the Hyksos kings as the Two Lands<button popovertarget="pop01">1</button> were reunited by his brother, <a href="/pharaohs/Ahmose-I">Ahmose I</a> - the founder of the <a href="/periods/new-kingdom">New Kingdom</a>.

<h2 class="mt-10 text-wrap">The chronological order</h3>

It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.

<h2 class="mt-10 text-wrap">The Seventeenth Dynasty according to <a href="/authors/manetho">Manetho</a></h2>
<p class="pb-6">
	According to Josephus, the Hyksos kings preceded the Eighteenth Dynasty kings. The information presented in the epitome used by Africanus was corrupted. This is evident by the creation of two distinct lineages of kings, which were then combined into a single entity, and the transfer of an identical number of kings to both.

		<p class="synk"><span>Syncellus:</span><br />It should be noted how Eusebios, to suit his own purpose, states that the kings who, according to Africanus' report, belonged to the 15th dynasty were part of the 17th dynasty. For it is agreed by all that Joseph was ruler of Egypt at the time of Aphophis. And as Eusebios was not at all able to put him during the reign of some other king, he transferred Aphophis from the 15th to the 17th dynasty. And he cut short the actual sixty-one years of his rule down to thirty, presented the 151 years of the whole dynasty as 103 years, and instead of six kings gave only four.
