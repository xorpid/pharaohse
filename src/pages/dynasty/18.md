<p><i>The Eighteenth Dynasty</i> is considered one of the most prosperous and powerful periods in ancient Egyptian history. Beginning with the rise of <i>Ahmose I</i>, who expelled the Hyksos invaders, the dynasty witnessed a golden age of Egyptian culture and military might. Pharaohs such as Queen <em>Hatshepsut</em>, <em>Amenhotep III</em> and the "heretic pharaoh" <em>Akhenaten</em> ruled during this time, overseeing a significant expansion of the empire through both conquest and diplomacy. The most widely known pharaoh in modern times is arguably <em>Tutankhamun</em>, whose tomb, containing a vast array of treasures, was discovered in 1922. 
</p>

<p>
The Eighteenth Dynasty is renowned for its artistic achievements, including the construction of monumental temples such as the Luxor and Karnak temples, as well as the development of the Amarna Period under Akhenaten.

<h2 class="mt-10">The chronological order</h2>
<p>
It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.

			I am of the opinion that Africanus was unaware that his 'Amos' was also known as 'Amosis', identical as well with Tethmosis the son of Aseth, as will be shown.

But during the reign of this first Amosis (that is, Amos according to Africanus), or four years before his rule, Moses was born, as has been shown, in AM 3732. During the reign of this second Amosis, also known as Misphragmouthosis, Moses went forth from Egypt with his people in AM 3812, his eightieth year.

			Before this Amosis, Eusebius erroneously made Aphophis the fourth and last ruler of the 17th dynasty, during whose reign there is universal agreement that Joseph was ruler of Egypt. According to him, he was king for fourteen years, even though all Eusebius' predecessors affirm that he reigned for sixty-one years. For by his illogical thinking&ndash;I dare not call it 'logic'&ndash;Ainosis preceded Moses and the Exodus by as many years. And Africanus also attests that Aphophis the sixth king in the 15th dynasty reigned over Egypt for sixty-one years.<br />Now if there is an apparent excess of years from Aphophis up to Amosis, this is the fault of disagreement among the Egyptians, since this is the way I found them in Manetho: for eighty years are more than the years from Joseph to Moses.

<p>
	The epitomist did not understand that not only had this dynasty four kings named <i>Amenhotep</i>, but also four kings named <i>Thutmose</i>. The similarity of the names made it very difficult to separete the names from each other, especially for a non-native Egyptian. The individual reigns add up to 262 years, not 263 as per Africanus, and curiously there is no reign mentioned for the first king. Also included is a subtotal: <i>Total 69 years from Amos to Misphragmouthosis</i>, however, the sum of these four reigns is 72. This subtotal suggest the presence of a summation, or perhaps a longer narrative. Further indication that the epitomators misinterpreted the text is that at the last two kings can only be Ramesses I and Seti I of the Nineteenth Dynasty.
</p>
<p>
	Egyptologists long have tried to reconcile the names of the four kings in 10-13 with the obscure Amarna kings, but there are too many discrepancies and inconsistencies to be conclusive. Josephus did not indicate a dynastic break in his list of the kings, but many of the names he supplied are spelled differently from Africanus and Eusebius. The order of kings is identical, however only Josephus indicate that <i>Amesses</i> and <i>Akenkheres</i> were actually female (see below.) All this, once again, suggest multiple and differing versions of Aegyptiaca.

Josephus, <i class="font-normal">Contra Apion</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
	<mid>1.15</mid> But now I shall produce the Egyptians as witnesses to the antiquity of our nation. I shall therefore here bring in Manetho again, and what he writes as to the order of the times in this case. And thus he speaks: <i>“When this people or shepherds were gone out of Egypt, to Jerusalem,<br>Tethmosis, the King of Egypt, who drove them out, reigned afterward twenty five years, and four months, and then died.<br> After him his son Chebron took the Kingdom, for thirteen years.<br> After whom came Amenophis, for twenty years, and seven months. <br>Then came his sister Amesses, for twenty one years, and nine months.<br> After her came Mephres, for twelve years, and nine months.<br> After him was Mephramuthosis, for twenty five years, and ten months.<br> After him was Thmosis, for nine years, and eight months.<br> After him came Amenophis, for thirty years, and ten months.<br> After him came Orus, for thirty six years, and five months.<br> Then came his daughter Acenchres, for twelve years, and one month.<br> Then was her brother Rathotis, for nine years.<br> Then was Acencheres, for twelve years, and five months.<br> Then came another Acencheres for twelve years, and three months.<br> After him Armais, for four years, and one month.<br> After him was Ramesses, for one year, and four months.<br> After him came Armesses Miammoun, for sixty six years, and two months.<br> After him Amenophis, for nineteen years and six months.<br> After him came Sethosis, and Ramesses; who had an army of horse, and a naval force. This King appointed his brother, Armais, to be his deputy over Egypt.”</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

Josephus provides a direct quotation from Manetho, and in contrast to the accounts provided by Africanus and Eusebius, there is no indication of a dynastic division between the last king of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Armais (Horemheb), and Ramesses I, the first king of the Nineteenth Dynasty.
