<p class="lead">
The Fourth Dynasty is best known for its monumental pyramid building, including the Great Pyramids of Giza. It was a period of stability, prosperity and cultural achievement, often referred to as the 'Golden Age' of the Old Kingdom.

<p>
It sounds unbelievable, but the pharaohs of this dynasty only ruled for a little more than a century, and yet they managed to have the three pyramids of Giza built in that time. It was under the pharaoh <a href="/pharaohs/Sneferu">Sneferu</a> that the construction of the first pyramids began - in fact, he built three of them. This was continued and improved upon by his son, <a href="/pharaohs/Khufu">Khufu</a>, also known as <i>Cheops</i>.
</p>
<p>
The line of succession of the first six pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty is well documented from contemporary and archeological records, but there are some discrepancies between the various New Kingdom king lists.
</p>

<ol class="px-5">
	<li><em>Djedefhor</em> was a son of Khufu and it is very unlikely that he ever ruled as pharaoh.</li>
	<li><em>Baefra</em> was allegedly another son of Khufu.</li>
	<li><em>Djedefptah</em>, another son of Khufu, whose name may have been Hellenised to <i>Thamphthis</i>, was, according to Africanus, the last ruler of the dynasty.</li>
</ol>
<p>
These three princes may have been mistakenly glorified as pharaohs by the time of the New Kingdom, which would explain their inclusion on the royal lists, although there is no archaeological evidence for them. There is the possibilty that rivals for the throne had all traces of their rule eradicated, but there are no proof either way.

<h2 class="mt-10">The chronological order</h2>
<p>
It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.

As can be seen from the differences between the more intact or complete text of Africanus and the missing information of Eusebius, the quality of their epitomes of Aegyptiaka must have been quite different.

<blockquote>
<p>
	<small class="not-italic">(2.124)</small> 
	Till the time of Rhampsinitus, Egypt (so the priests told me) was in all ways well governed and greatly prospered, but Cheops, who was the next king, brought the people to utter misery. For first he shut up all the temples, so that none could sacrifice there; and next, he compelled all the Egyptians to work for him, appointing some to drag stones from the quarries in the Arabian mountains to the Nile. 
</p>
<p>
	<small class="not-italic">(2.127)</small> 
	Cheops reigned (so the Egyptians said) for fifty years; at his death he was succeeded by his brother Chephren, who bore himself in all respects like Cheops. Chephren also built a pyramid, of a less size than his brother's. Chephren, he said, reigned for fifty‑six years. 
</p>
<p>
	<small class="not-italic">(2.129)</small> 
	The next king of Egypt, they said, was Cheops' son Mycerinus. He, being displeased with his father's doings, opened the temples and suffered the people, now ground down to the depth of misery, to go to their business and their sacrifices; and he was the justest judge among all the Greeks. It is on this account that he is praised beyond all the rulers of Egypt; for not only were his judgments just, but if any were not contented with the sentence Mycerinus would give such an one a present out of his own estate to satisfy him for his loss.

<div id="pop01" popover><p>1</p> The reference from Herodotus, lacking in Syncellus MS <strong>B</strong>, might be a later addition. See Herodotus section below.</div>
<div id="pop02" popover><p>2</p> This report about the purchase of the Sacred Book is probably a comment by Africanus.</div>

<div id="pop04" popover><p>4</p> The sum of the years of the first four dynasties comes to 1043; the discrepancy between the totals can be reconciled by emending the 274 years of the Fourth Dynasty to 277 following MS <strong>B</strong>.</div>
