<p class="lead">
The Sixth Dynasty is considered to be the last dynasty of the Old Kingdom. According to Manetho, they ruled from Memphis, and since their pyramids were built nearby at Saqqara, this seems very plausible.

<p>The long reign of Pepi II paved the way for officials and the nobility to consolidate their power and influence, while weakening the power of the king. The  After his death, the various nobles probably fought for the throne, plunging the kingdom into open revolt and the rapid decline of the <a href="/period/old-kingdom">Old Kingdom</a>.<br /><br />The confusion in the records of Manetho suggests that the central administration broke down at the end of the Sixth Dynasty. The kingdom entered the <a href="/period/first-intermediate-period">First Intermediate Period</a>, an very obscure century with very little contemporary evidence.</p>

<h2 class="mt-10">The chronological order</h2>

<p>It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.

<h2 class="mt-10 text-wrap">The Sixth Dynasty according to <a href="/kinglists/manetho">Manetho</a></h2>

<p class="pb-6">Eusebius displaced the kings from this dynasty into his Fifth Dynasty, suggesting a sorrupted epitome. Africanus epitome of <i>Aegyptiaka</i> was clearly quite different, as can be seen from the differences between the more complete text of Africanus and the missing information of Eusebius.</p>

<div id="pop01" popover><p>1</p> According to this notice, Phiops ruled only 94 years. Africanus provided no total, perhaps it was missing in his epitome. But Syncellus' total years of 203 years for the Sixth Dynasty assumes that his reign lasted for 100 years instead of the provided 94 years.</div>
<div id="pop02" popover><p>2</p> Syncellus' total of 203 years assumes that Phiops reign lasted for 100 years instead of the provided 94 years. The correct sum is 197 for the dynasty.</div>
