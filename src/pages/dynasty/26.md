<p>
This dynasty is also known as the <em>Saite Period</em>, named after the city of Sais where its pharaohs established their capital. The founder of the dynasty, Psamtik I, was probably a descendant of Bakenrenef of the Twenty-fourth Dynasty. There was a revival of Old Kingdom artistic and architectural styles, with a focus on monumental constructions, temple restorations and fine craftsmanship. The dynasty emphasised Egyptian traditions while also embracing foreign influences, particularly those from Greece. It balanced native traditions with foreign alliances, leaving a legacy of art, architecture, and maritime exploration.</p>
<p>In 525 BC, the Persian king Cambyses II invaded Egypt and defeated Psamtik III, the last Saite ruler, at the Battle of Pelusium. Psamtik III was captured and Egypt was swiftly incorporated into the Achaemenid Persian Empire as a satrapy. Psamtik III's reign lasted only about six months, and his rapid defeat marked the sudden end of the Saite Dynasty’s rule and Egypt’s independence.</p>

<h2>The chronological order</h2>
<p>
It is important to note that the chronological order and dates of the kings is still a matter of debate and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.

When the Nubian king defeated Bakenrenef of the Twenty-fourth Dynasty, he probably appointed a Nubian as governor of Sais, possibly Ammeris or Ameres 'the Ethiopian' mentioned by EUsebius. While there is agreement on the names of the first and last kings, there is disagreement on the years.
