Alexander III of Macedon, most commonly known as Alexander the Great, was crowned king of Egypt in the temple of Ptah at Memphis in 332 BC after a bloodless entry into Egypt.
</p>
<p>
The Egyptian populace did not find it problematic that he was a foreigner, nor that he was absent for the majority of his reign. Indeed they seems to have greeted him as a liberator. Alexander restored the temples that had been neglected by the Persians and erected new monuments in honour of the Egyptian gods. During his relatively brief tenure in Egypt, he reformed the taxation system on the Greek models and organised the military occupation of the country. However, after only a few months in Egypt, he departed for Asia in pursuit of the Persians.
