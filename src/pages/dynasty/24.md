Seeking to conquer Upper Egypt, Tefnakht rallied the princes of the Delta to extend his control from Sais, thereby challenging the Twenty-second and Twenty-third dynasties. However, this aggressive expansion attracted the attention of the Nubian Twenty-fifth Dynasty, who invaded in an attempt to curb Tefnakht’s ambitions. The campaign ended in failure as Piye, who recorded his conquest of Tefnakhte and his peers in a well-known inscription.<button popovertarget="pop01">1</button> The dynasty came to a sudden end under the reign of Tefnakht’s son, Bakenrenef (also known as Bocchoris), who was captured and burned alive.

<h2>The chronological order</h2>
<p class="pb-6">
It is important to note that the chronological order and dates of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties. In particular, the <i>Intermediate Periods</i> are the subject of significant ongoing research, and could see dramatic changes in the future.

Aelian, <i class="font-normal">On the Nature of Animals</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
	<mid>12.3</mid> The Egyptians assert (though they are far from convincing me), they assert, I say, that in the days of the far-famed Bocchoris a lamb was born with eight feet and two tails, and that it spoke. They say also that this lamb had two heads and four horns. It is right to forgive Homer who bestows speech upon Xanthus the horse, for Homer is a poet. And Alcman could not be censured for imitating Homer in such matters, for the first venture of Homer is a plea sufficient to justify forgiveness. But how can one pay any regard to Egyptians who exaggerate like this? However, fabulous though they be, I have related the peculiarities of this lamb.
