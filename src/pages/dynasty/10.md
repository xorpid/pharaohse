Following the Ninth Herakleopolitan dynasty, Manetho list yet another dynasty from the same city.

<p>
	It seems likely that the copyist of the epitome of Manetho misunderstood the summation for the Herakleopolitan dynasty, and separated it into two dynasties. Africanus give 19 + 19 kings for the two dynasties, while Eusebius give 4 + 19 kings. The number of years also differ, and it stands to reason that the copyist misinterpreted a summation of the Herakleopolitan Dynasty and multiplied it as a new dynasty, substantiated by the same number of kings (19) for both dynasties, with no names mentioned.
</p>
<p>
	The difference in the number of kings and years between Africanus and Eusebius for dynasties 9 and 10 is another clear indication that their epitomes differed substantially. The summation for the Ninth/Tenth Dynasties in the <a href="/kinglists/turin">Turin King List</a> lists 18 kings,<button popovertarget="pop01">1</button> however the names of most of them are also missing. Unlike many other king lists, this one records these 18 kings as an unbroken sequence without any dynastic breaks.

<h2 class="mt-10">The chronological order</h2>
<p>
It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.

<p class="pb-6">
As can be seen from the differences between the more complete text of Africanus and the missing information in Eusebius's account of the earlier dynasties, the contents of their epitomes of Aegyptiaca must have been quite different. However, this does not necessarily indicate which text is more accurate.
