<p class="lead">A foreign dynasty, as Egypt was re-conquered by the Persian Empire, and its status once again reduced to that of a province.</p>
<p>
An appointed governor, or <i>satrap</i>, ruled in the name of the emperor and often left local administration to Egyptian elites under Persian oversight. Also known as the <i>Second Persian Domination</i> or the <i>Second Egyptian Satrapy</i>.

<h2>The chronological order</h2>
<p>
It is important to note that the chronological order and dates of the kings is still a matter of debate and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that <i>applies to all</i> Egyptian dynasties.
