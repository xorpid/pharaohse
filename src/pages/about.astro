			This whole thing started out as a couple disjoined pages of collected images and notes. Over the years it became more refined, but like many
			projects, it grew beyond its initial scope. So I created this site to try to organise the sources of the names of the pharaohs, with references
			and hieroglyphs freely available online.
		</p>

		<p>
			Almost all hieroglyphs presented has been verified by visual inspection of the sources mentioned. This is a hobby, I am not an Egyptologist. I
			add to this website when time permits. The site is primarily designed for and intended to be read on a computer screen, but works fine on phones
			and tablets too.

			For historical or general information about pharaohs, <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pharaohs"
				target="_blank"
				class="font-normal"
				rel="noopener nofollow">this Wikipedia page</a
			> is a much better place <b>to start</b>. The order of succession is disputed by Egyptologists for a number of pharaohs â€” in some cases their
			very existence. This website concentrates on the actual names, not on discussions about which pharaoh should be placed where. I have tried to
			follow the general consensus, but this is not always easy, as progression takes years to complete and is often hidden away in obscure journals
			that are only available to the academic community. The aim is to provide a source of information about ancient Egypt that is free, reliable, and
			hopefully impartial and unbiased.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Always check with the original sources to ensure you are getting accurate information</strong> and, where possible, verify that the source
			is correct and not just repeating potentially flawed information. Also bear in mind that books often have second editions with updated information,
			so make sure you have the right one.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is up to you which information to trust, but you should always check the sources anyway &ndash; before repeating potentially incorrect
			information. Yes, that includes this website! There will inevitably be errors, typos, omissions and other (hopefully minor) problems on these
			pages.
		</p>
		<p>
			A big problem with websites is that they inevitably disappear. This will happen to this website too. With printed book, there is always the
			possibility of finding a physical copy. When a domain name disappears, the information is lost unless it has been archived. But a digital
			archive can disappear in the blink of an eye. Yes, books are not immune to destruction, but they can survive without electricity. Furthermore,
			digital records are susceptible to manipulation, whereas physical books has to be printed and are less vulnerable to such alterations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Try to locate a physical source and remember that <i>digital manipulation is trivial.</i> Try to use multiple sources from different locations if
			possible (maybe a little too paranoid?). Please note that the information contained in these pages may include mistakes or missing details. I apologize
			for any errors. This is not intentional.
		</p>
		<p>
			As of mid-2025, AI technology is beginning to replace websites by generating summaries of lengthy texts for quick consumption. Whether the
			information provided by the AIs can be relied upon is a major concern. I have personally seen many examples of information provided by AIs that
			are completely incorrect, but presented as if factual and correct. Also, the ability to control what information the AIs are <i>allowed</i> to divulge
			poses a real threat to the free flow of information. The question is not if, but when, someone will abuse the power of the AIs for their own benefit.
			Ultimately, AI may be a good thing?
