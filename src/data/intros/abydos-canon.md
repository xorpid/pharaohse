<p class="lead">The Abydos Canon, also known as the Abydos Table or Abydos king list is a list with the names of 76 pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.</p><p>It is still in place, on a wall in the Mortuary Temple of Seti I at <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=26.184476,31.919142&t=k" class="nou s12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="Open location in Google Maps">Abydos in Egypt</a>.</p><p>The king list was part of a ritual where the spirits of the ancestors were invoked. The names on the list celebrated and memorialized "ancestors" of Seti I, and was not meant to be a historically correct chronological list. It shows only pharaohs that were selected as worthy of admiration and respect. Queen Hatshepsut and the <abbr title="i.e. Akhenaten, Smenkhkara, Neferneferuaten, Tutankhamun, and Ay">Amarna period pharaohs</abbr> were not included, nor any from the Second Intermediate Period.</p><p class="right"><img loading="lazy" class="img-fluid" src="images/canon-ac.jpg" alt="Abydos Canon king list" /><span class="s65">Image credit: <a class="bw" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Abydos_K%C3%B6nigsliste_stitched_1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons</a></span></p><p>The inscribed list of kings is found in the Mortuary Temple of Seti I, on the right wall of the passage coming from the second Hypostyle Hall, referred to as the Gallery of Lists. Seti I is on the left wearing the blue crown, holding a censor in one hand and gesturing towards the right with the other. In front of him, young prince Ramesses is shown holding a papyrus to read from with an accompanying text before him:</p><p class="mx-5"><em>Reciting praises by the hereditary prince; the eldest, of his body, his beloved (son), Ramesses, justified, true of voice.</em></p><p>The text runs in six vertical columns above Ramesses, and is the speech given by Seti I:</p><p class="mx-5"><em>Words spoken by King Menmaatra. Bringing the god to his food offering, the making of offerings for the kings of Upper and Lower Egypt. Greetings to thee, Ptah Sokar, who is South-of-His Wall! Come, that I may make for thee these (things) which Horus made for his father Osiris.</em></p><p>The first fifty-six names shows an orderly progression of legitime rulers of Memphis. The kings who are not included are those whose rule over the Two Lands is questioned or who had some measure of political/religious bias towards them, for example, not ruling from Memphis.</p><div class="pt-3 pb-5"><img loading="lazy" class="img-fluid" src="images/canon-ac.png" alt="Abydos Canon king list drawing" /></div><h2 class="py-3">Content of the list</h2><p class="pb-5">The list consists of three rows of thirty-eight cartouches on each row. The upper two rows contain names of the ancestral kings, while the third row repeats Seti I’s throne- and birth-names. In all, seventy-six kings are mentioned. The hieroglyphics are read from left to right, the upper row is read before the lower. The cartouches of the kings are preceded by the words <em>n nisu</em>, which translates as "To king.....". The third row with Seti’s names is preceded by "By the gift of.....".</p>
