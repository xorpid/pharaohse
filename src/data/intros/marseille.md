<p class="lead">Also known as the <i>Offering Table of Qenhirkhopshef</i>, was originally located in the Karnak temple complex. The top side used for offerings was made in the shape of the hieroglyph <img class="inline pb-2 h-8 dark:invert mb-1" src="/svg/hotep.svg" alt="Hotep hieroglyph"> <tlit>ḥtp</tlit> (hotep), depicting an offering altar/table.</p>
<p>It was likely made in the reign of the Nineteenth Dynasty pharaoh <a href="/ancient-egypt/pharaoh/Merenptah">Merenptah</a> or his son <a href="/ancient-egypt/pharaoh/Seti-II">Seti II</a>. The 34 cartouches contain 30 royal names of 17 pharaohs, of which four are the (omitted here) names of Ahmose’s mother and wife (numbers 8, 9, 33, and 34). It now resides at the museum <i>Musée d’Archéologie Méditerranéenne</i> (Collection Clot-Bey, Inv. No. 204, <i>Table d’offrandes de Qenherkhepeshef</i>) in Marseille, France.<br />It is not a huge piece, its dimensions are 39 cm &times; 34 cm &times; 15 cm.</p>
<p>The offering starts on both sides of the run-off spout with the phrase <tlit>ḥtp-ḏi-nsw</tlit>, <i>“an offering given by the king”</i> which allowed offerings presented to the gods in the name of the king. There is also a figure of the owner, the Royal scribe in the palace of Truth, with the partial name Qen, presumed to be Qenhirkhopshef.</p>

<p>Note: Cartouche 14 contains <i>Aa-kheperu-en-ra</i> which must be a mistake/variant for <i>Aa-kheperu-ra</i>, the prenomen of Amenhotep <span aria-label="two">II</span>. The similar prenomen of Thutmose <span aria-label="two">II</span> (<i>Aa-kheper-en-ra</i>), is already present (12 and 24).</p>
