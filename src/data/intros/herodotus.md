<p class="lead">Herodotus traveled Asia and northern Africa, his second volume of <b>Histories</b> describes Egypt’s geography, people and relates stories about a number of pharaohs.</p>

<p>Herodotus was born about 490 BC in Halicarnassos (an ancient Greek city in Anatolia, in modern Turkey) and visited Egypt during the first period of Persian domination around 450 BC. While many of his stories might only be myths or legends, it is the earliest known book that contains the actual names of pharaohs, not just the title <i>pharaoh</i>.</p>

<p>As a <a href="/articles/chronology" class="font-normal">chronology</a> it is almost worthless, for instance, he placed the pyramid builders of the Old Kingdom <em>after</em> the New Kingdom. Some of the named pharaohs are clearly compounded from more than one pharaoh.</p>

<p>Many of the known names of the pharaohs can be traced back to Herodotus. In most cases the information is unreliable and of very little historical credibility, but then again he was simply reporting what he was told. Herodotus' main value is as a record of historical traditions in Egypt during the 5th century BC. The kings mentioned are listed below.</p>
