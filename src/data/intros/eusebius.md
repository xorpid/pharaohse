	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusebius" target="_blank">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> (c. 263–339 CE) was a Roman priest and historian who
	wrote “Universal History” divided into two books. It is also called the <i>Chronicon</i> or, <i>The Chronicle</i> and was written in Greek.
</p>
<p>
	The original books are lost, but quotations are preserved by later historians, which makes it possible to reconstruct his work. Both books
	survive in a translation to Armenian, and Jerome’s latin translation preserve the second book. Syncellus made substantial quotes of Eusebius
	and thus preserved his work too. Eusebius’ account is less detailed than Africanus’, omitting numerous rulers and their details, indicating
	that his source was imperfect and inferior. The last date preserved is 325 CE.
</p>
<p>
	The first part, <b>the Chronography</b>, is a sort of narrative of universal history from the sources, arranged by nation.
</p>
<p>
	The second part, <b>the Canons</b>, put the historical material into a parallel timeline, listing the reigns of each nation side-by-side, for
	every year.
