	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Africanus" target="_blank">Julius Africanus</a> (c.160 – c.240) was a Christian historian who wrote
	a history of the world in five books called <i>Chronographiae</i>, from the creation of the world to 221 CE. The original has been lost, and no fragments have ever been found. Attempts to reconstruct the work relies entirely on later authors who quoted Africanus, primarily Eusebius.
</p>
<p>
	There are also fragments in Syncellus, Cedrenus and the Chronicon Paschale. It contained material from Manetho’s
	<i>Aegyptiaca</i>, or rather, material from one of the many <abbr title="a summary of a written work, i.e. a copy of a manuscript"
		>epitomes</abbr
	> of Aegyptiaca created during the intervening 500 years that passed between the two authors. Manetho's invention was to arrange the extremely long history of ancient Egypt into more manageable parts, which he called <em>dynasties</em>.
</p>
<p>
	As can be expected, the original text of Aegyptiaca was corrupted long before it reached Africanus, as transmission during the intervening
	centuries undoubtedly required copies of copies to be created. This copying process naturally introduced errors, omissions and
	misunderstanding of the source text. There were also outright alterations by religious redactors. The epitome used by Africanus was in all
	likelyhood a somewhat contemporary copy, i.e. removed from Manetho by some 4-500 years.
</p>
<p>
	As Africanus Chronographiai predates Eusebius’ by a century it is generally considered more reliable by Egyptologists. Syncellus recognized
	the similarity between Africanus and Eusebius and presented both versions in his Ecloga Chronographica.
</p>
<p>
	Due to the fact that the original has not survived is a big problem, as the information that can be gleaned, is from copies of copies, which
	in themselves cannot be entirely relied upon.
