**Diodorus Siculus** was a Greek historian born in Sicily. His magnum opus, _Bibliotheca Historica_, consisted of forty books divided into three sections, and was likely begun in the 40s BC. The last book is believed to have been completed before Octavian's incorporation of Egypt as a Roman province in 30 BC, which is not mentioned by Diodorus.

The first book describes the history and culture of Egypt. Below are the names of the kings mentioned, with a brief description. He used the works of earlier historians, such as Herodotus, and adapted events and stories to suit his own purpose. The stories lack a clear chronology, making it difficult to identify the pharaohs associated with each story; they are often amalgamations of many kings, or confused with later kings and periods. His first-hand account of his visit to Egypt and his interactions with the priests is still valuable, with otherwise unobtainable information about ancient Egypt.
