<p class="lead px-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus" target="_blank">Titus Flavius Josephus</a> (37 – c. 100) was a first century Jewish historian who wrote <i>Against Apion</i> (Contra Apionem), which is a polemical work written as a defense of Judaism, stressing its antiquity against what he perceived as more recent traditions of the Greeks.</p>
<p>As Josephus himself notes, it does not contain quotations from Manetho’s original, but rather cites from one or perhaps even two epitomized and altered version of Manetho’s Aegyptiaca. Written as a narrative, it covers only a portion of Manetho’s history, roughly from the Fifteenth through the Nineteenth dynasties, but it does describe shifts in control from one faction to another, consistent with dynastic divisions. There is no mention of numbered dynasties, and only 24 rulers are named.<br><br>The original Greek manuscript is lost, and is only preserved in a single imperfect copy: <i>Codex Laurentianus LXIX.22</i>, a copy from the 11th century, from which all other existing manuscripts are descended.<br><br>The pharaohs are mentioned in Book 1, 1.14 to 1.16 (§§ 77—97) and the kings of the New Kingdom are listed without any mention of dynastic breaks:</p>
