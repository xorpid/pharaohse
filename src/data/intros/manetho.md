<h2 class="text-center pb-3">Mythological kings</h2>
<p>
	Neither Africanus nor Eusebius preserve any names or dates for the mythological era. According to Syncellus, the <i>Book of Sothis</i> was written
	by Manetho, though modern scholars consider it a much later forgery, used by Panodorus of Alexandria.
</p>
<p>
	The lists begin with a number of mythological kings that include Gods, demigods and spirits of the dead. The Gods reigned 11,985 years. The only
	original number presented in Table 1 is the 9,000 years reign of Hephaistos. The incredible time-spans presented by Manetho was considered
	impossibly high by Christian authors, so a numerical contortion was necessary whereby it was assumed that Manetho's figure was referring to solar
	days, not years. That meant that the 9,000 years was converted into 29.5-day months, yielding a total of 265,500 days, or 727.75 years. The
	formula: (Panodorus figure) &times; 365 / 29.5 = original Sothis figure.

			Some of them [the priests] give the story that at first gods and heroes ruled Egypt for a little less than 18,000 years, the last of the gods to rule being Horus, the son of Isis; and mortals have been kings over their country, they say, for a little less than 5,000 years down to the 180th Olympiad, the time when we visited Egypt and the king was Ptolemy, who took the name of The New Dionysus.<!--<a href="#" data-target="1">1</a> -->

		<p>
			The eight kings from the archaeological records of the First Dynasty align with Manetho and also with the Turin king list. The reigns of the
			first four kings differ, while the last four are identical, suggesting corrupted information in one (or both?) of the epitomes used, unless
			the error was caused by Syncellus or his copyists. Interestingly, the names are the opposite; the names of the first four are identical, while
			the last four differ.
		</p>
		<p>
			It seems unlikely that both Africanus and Eusebius made simple errors in adding up the reigns. Instead, the discrepancies in the totals are
			easily explained by errors made by later copyists.

				The Egyptian Second Dynasty was ruled by nine kings (from Thinis). During Boethos' rule, a chasm appeared in Bubastis, killing numerous
				people. The bulls Apis at Memphis and Meneus in Heliopolis, as well as the Mendesian goat, were considered as gods during Kaiechos' rule.
				Binothris granted women royal privileges. For eleven days under Nephercheres' reign, the Nile River flowed with honey. Sesochris was a big
				man, five cubits tall and three cubits wide.

		The Second Dynasty in Ancient Egypt is shrouded in obscurity, making it one of the most enigmatic chapters in the country's history. The

			The nine kings are the same number as in the Turin king list, although the Abydos Canon only has six, while the Saqqara Canon has eight. The
			individual reigns of Africanus add up to 302 years, while Eusebius’ total is 297. Interestingly, Africanus and Eusebius both summarise the
			first two dynasties, reminiscent of the Turin King List summations, which does not feasture a summation at this point.
		</p>
		<p>
			The total of Africanus First and Second dynasties are stated as 555 years (253+302), however, the actual total for the individual kings is 565
			(263+302), due to the 10-year discrepancy from the First Dynasty. According to Eusebius, the total for the two dynasties is 549 (252+297), but
			the individual reigns cannot be counted as there is obviously a lacuna in Second Dynasty records of his epitome of Aegyptiaca. The Armenian
			translation does not include the summation for the first two dynasties of Eusebius.

		The sum of the individual reigns is 197, however, Phiops <i
			>“whose reign began at the age of 6, ruled continuously up to his hundredth year”,</i
		> was calculated as 100 instead of 94. The Turin king list detail 13 sequential kings of the Sixth Dynasty without any indication of a dynastic
		break between the Sixth and Eleventh dynasties. At the same place, the Abydos Canon contain the names of 23 kings, while the Saqqara Canon only
		have 4. This further reinforce that the New Kingdom records were corrupted, or at the very least, incomplete.
	</p>
	<p>
		According to Africanus, the total sum for the kings of the First through Sixth dynasties amount to 1497 years (1294+203), however the correct
		sum is 1478 (1281+197). The summation for the same six dynasties in the Turin king list give a total of 955 years, and only 13 kings from Teti
		to the Ninth Dynasty kings.
	</p>
	<p>
		The administrative records from the First Intermediate Period appear to have suffered greatly, whether as a result of conflict or just bad
		luck, as even Manetho failed to piece together the disjointed parts into a cohesive chronology. However, it is impossible to rule out that an
		epitomist misinterpreted the whole section of the narrative and caused mayhem.

		The huge number of kings and dynasties for the First Intermediate Period suggest that a redactor of an Epitome misunderstood and distorted the

		Sixteen kings ruling 43 years is clearly another error by the redactor of the epitome. Yet another indication is that Ammenemes was king
		Ammenemes was not included in the Eleventh or Twelfth dynasties, but rather as an intermediary between the two. Africanus presents a summation

	According to modern Egyptology, some 90 kings reigned from the First through Eleventh dynasties (approximately 1100 years). The figures by
	Africanus for dynasties 7-10 are in all likelihood based on a misunderstanding of the text. It is clear that the Seventh Dynasty is a mistake.
	The line of kings of Memphis continued rule past the Sixth Dynasty - this could be the 27 kings of Africanus’ Eighth Dynasty. According to
	Africanus, the next two dynasties were Herakleopolitan, both with 19 kings. It seems probable that the redactor mistook the summation of the
	Eighth Dynasty and erroneously created a duplicate of the dynasty. The corresponding dynasty in the Turin king list holds 18 kings (5.18-6.9).
</p>
<p>
	Disregarding the duplicated dynasties, Africanus recorded 49 kings from the First through Sixth dynasties, 27 kings of the Memphite Eighth
	Dynasty, and 19 kings of the Herakleopolitan Ninth Dynasty, and finally, 16 kings of the Eleventh Dynasty, for a total of 111 kings. The 16
	kings of the Eleventh Dynasty is an aberration, as contemporary sources show that only seven kings reigned in this dynasty. Removing the 9
	extraneous kings, would bring the total down to 102 kings.

		According to Africanus and Eusebius both, seven kings belong to Dynasty 12. While Africanus name all seven, Eusebius only name the first four.
		This is a clear indication that the epitome used by Africanus was more complete. The summation of Eusebius also give a total of 245 years for
		the dynasty, while the total of the four named kings amount to 170, with no account of the last three kings. Perhaps the epitomist of Eusebius
		did not understand that there were multiple kings named Amenemhat and Senusret, rejecting similar names as a copying error. The redactor of
		the Epitome failed to understand that Manetho’s narrative contained not only four kings named Amenemmes, and three kings named Sestoris, but
		most of them also had coregencies with their sons. This confusion of the identity of the kings and their reigns resulted in disarray &ndash;
		from Ammenemes to Skemiophris.

		The sheer number of kings and length of the reigns shows that the texts of Manetho were not properly understood by the redactor. It could well
		be that there was a longer summation of all the kings up to this point, but the context was lost in translation, which would help explain the
		large number of kings attributed to this period. Perhaps the records available to Manetho was full of lacunae, just like the tattered Turin
		king list, and further distorted by an incorrect translation.

				<!-- The manuscripts of Syncellus erroneously assign 43 shepherd kings and 43 kings of Theban Diospolis to the 17th dynasty.

			[<small>Syncellus (T46b): <i>It should be noted how Eusebius, to suit his own purpose, states that the kings who, according to Africanus' report, belonged to the 15th dynasty were part of the 17th dynasty. For it is agreed by all that Joseph was ruler of Egypt at the time of Aphophis. And as Eusebius was not at all able to put him during the reign of some other king, he transferred Aphophis from the 15th to the 17th dynasty. And he cut short the actual 61 years of his rule down to 30, presented the 151 years of the whole dynasty as 103 years, and instead of six kings gave only four</i>.</small>] -->

		According to Josephus, the Hyksos kings preceded the Eighteenth Dynasty kings. The redactor of the epitome misunderstood the text by creating
		two dynasties yet combining them into one, transferring of an identical number of kings to both. Comparing the description of this dynasty by
		Africanus “43 additional shepherd kings, and 43 kings of Theban Diospolis, total reigns of the shepherds and Theban kings, 151 years” to
		Eusebius “they were shepherds and brothers, foreign kings from Phoenicia, who also seized Memphis”, it is clear that they had contradicting
		versions of Aegyptiaca, or the text was translated differently by their redactors.

		<!-- See Waddell p 99 !!!! --> Manetho’s epitomes definitely contained contradictory material, or at the very least a confusing narrative that
		the epitomist did not fully comprehend. While Josephus presents Manetho’s Hyksos in detail, the Africanus and Eusebius provide a jumble of kings
		and dynasties of different length and number, also revealing a pattern of transposition of both reigns and kings. Kings 3 and 4 are interchanged
		in the Armenian translation compared to Eusebius.

		The redactor(s) of the Epitome did not understand that not only had this dynasty four kings named <i>Amenhotep</i>, but also four kings named <i
			>Thutmose</i
		>. The similarity of the names made it very difficult to separete the names from each other, especially if coregencies were also mentioned.
		The individual reigns add up to 262 years, not 263 as per Africanus, and curiously there is no reign mentioned for the first king. Also
		included is a subtotal: <i>Total 69 years from Amos to Misphragmouthosis</i>, however, the sum of these four reigns is 72. Goar emended
		Amenophthis’ 24 years to 21 to account for the discrepancy, probably based on the 21 years assigned to this king by Eusebius. This subtotal
		suggest the presence of a summation, or perhaps a longer narrative. Further indication that the epitomists misinterpreted the text is that at
		the end of the list we find what can only be Ramesses II and Merenptah of the next dynasty.
	</p>
	<p>
		Egyptologists long have tried to reconcile the names of the four kings in 10-13 with the obscure Amarna kings, but there are too many
		discrepancies and inconsistencies to be conclusive. Josephus did not indicate a dynastic break in his list of the kings, but many of the names
		he supplied are spelled differently from Africanus and Eusebius. The order of kings is identical, however only Josephus indicate that <i
			>Amesses</i
		> and <i>Akenkheres</i> were actually Queens. All this, once again, suggest multiple and differing versions of Aegyptiaca.

	<p>
		Despite a few obvious errors, Manetho's versions provide a remarkable level of concordance given the multiple copies generated through
		centuries of transmission. Most names have little resemblance to the names belonging to the rulers of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Attempts to
		match Manetho's rulers are far from convincing, as the Greek transcription of names necessitates doubtful linguistic acrobatics.
	</p>
	<p>
		Things to consider: Amenhotep IV name change to Akhenaten could mean that Manetho added both names as separate kings in his list. Perhaps
		there was a failed attempt to establish a king opposing Akhenaten of which no archaeological record remain, yet were preserved by Manetho?
